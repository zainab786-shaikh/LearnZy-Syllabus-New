    <h1>5.5 Inheritance and Composition in Classes</h1>
    <p>In object-oriented programming (OOP), Inheritance and Composition are two important ways to create relationships between classes. These concepts help in code reusability, modularity, and organization of programs.</p>
    <h2>1. Inheritance (Is-a Relationship)</h2>
    <h3>What is Inheritance?</h3>
    <p>Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a new class to inherit properties and methods from an existing class. This helps in avoiding repetition and makes the code more organized and reusable.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Parent Class (Super Class)</strong> – The class whose properties and methods are inherited.</li>
      <li><strong>Child Class (Sub Class)</strong> – The class that inherits from the parent class.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Example of Inheritance:</h3>
    <p>Imagine you are designing a system for different types of vehicles. Instead of writing the same attributes (like speed, color, brand) for every type of vehicle, we can create a base class and let other vehicle types inherit from it.</p>
    <pre>
      <code>
  # Parent class
  class Vehicle:
      def __init__(self, brand, color, speed):
          self.brand = brand
          self.color = color
          self.speed = speed
  
      def show_info(self):
          print(f"Brand: {self.brand}, Color: {self.color}, Speed: {self.speed} km/h")
  
  # Child class (inherits from Vehicle)
  class Car(Vehicle):
      def __init__(self, brand, color, speed, fuel_type):
          super().__init__(brand, color, speed)
          self.fuel_type = fuel_type
  
      def show_car_info(self):
          self.show_info()
          print(f"Fuel Type: {self.fuel_type}")
      </code>
    </pre>
    <h2>2. Composition (Has-a Relationship)</h2>
    <h3>What is Composition?</h3>
    <p>Composition is when a class contains an object of another class as a part of its attributes. Instead of inheriting, it uses another class inside it.</p>
    <h3>Example of Composition:</h3>
    <pre>
      <code>
  # Separate class for Engine
  class Engine:
      def __init__(self, horsepower, type):
          self.horsepower = horsepower
          self.type = type
  
      def show_engine_info(self):
          print(f"Engine: {self.horsepower} HP, Type: {self.type}")
  
  # Car class has an Engine (Composition)
  class Car:
      def __init__(self, brand, color, speed, engine):
          self.brand = brand
          self.color = color
          self.speed = speed
          self.engine = engine
  
      def show_car_info(self):
          print(f"Brand: {self.brand}, Color: {self.color}, Speed: {self.speed} km/h")
          self.engine.show_engine_info()
      </code>
    </pre>

        <td>Relationship</td>
        <td>Strong relationship (Parent-Child)</td>
        <td>Loose relationship (Objects work together)</td>

    <h2>4. When to Use Inheritance vs Composition?</h2>
    <table border="1">
      <tr>
        <th>Situation</th>
        <th>Use Inheritance</th>
        <th>Use Composition</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Objects are logically related (e.g., "A Car is a Vehicle")</td>
        <td>✅ Yes</td>
        <td>❌ No</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>One class contains another class (e.g., "A Car has an Engine")</td>
        <td>❌ No</td>
        <td>✅ Yes</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Game Development</td>
        <td>Enemy inherits from Character</td>
        <td>Game has a Scoreboard</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Use <strong>Inheritance</strong> when one class "is a" type of another.</p>
    <p>Use <strong>Composition</strong> when one class "has a" relationship with another.</p>
    <p>Both Inheritance and Composition are useful depending on the situation. The key is to choose the right approach based on the relationship between the objects.</p>
