  <h1>1.1 Features of Python</h1>
  <p>
    Python is a powerful, easy-to-learn, and widely used programming language.
    It is popular because of its simplicity and flexibility, making it a great
    choice for both beginners and experienced programmers.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Easy to Learn and Use</h2>
  <p>
    Python has a simple and easy-to-read syntax, making it beginner-friendly.
    Unlike other programming languages like C or Java, Python code is more like
    English, which makes it easy to understand.
  </p>
  <pre><code>print("Hello, World!")</code></pre>

  <h2>2. Interpreted Language</h2>
  <p>
    Python does not require compilation like Java or C++. Instead, it runs code
    line by line, which makes debugging easier.
  </p>
  <pre><code>a = 5
  b = 3
  print(a + b)  # Output: 8</code></pre>

  <h2>3. Free and Open Source</h2>
  <p>
    Python is free to download and use. It is also open-source, meaning anyone
    can contribute to its development.
  </p>
  <p>
    Download Python from:
    <a href="https://www.python.org">https://www.python.org</a>
  </p>

  <h2>4. High-Level Language</h2>
  <p>
    Python is a high-level language, meaning you don’t need to worry about
    hardware details like memory management.
  </p>
  <pre><code>a = 10</code></pre>

  <h2>5. Platform Independent (Cross-Platform)</h2>
  <p>
    Python programs can run on different operating systems like Windows, macOS,
    and Linux without modification.
  </p>
  <pre><code>print("This will run on any OS!")</code></pre>

  <h2>6. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</h2>
  <p>
    Python supports object-oriented programming, meaning you can use objects and
    classes to organize code efficiently.
  </p>
  <pre><code>class Car:
      def __init__(self, brand, color):
          self.brand = brand
          self.color = color
      
      def show_details(self):
          print(f"Car Brand: {self.brand}, Color: {self.color}")
  
  car1 = Car("Toyota", "Red")
  car1.show_details()</code></pre>

  <h2>7. Large Standard Library</h2>
  <p>
    Python comes with a huge collection of built-in modules and functions, so
    you don’t have to write everything from scratch.
  </p>
  <pre><code>import math
  print(math.sqrt(16))  # Output: 4.0</code></pre>

  <h2>8. Dynamically Typed</h2>
  <p>
    You don’t need to declare the data type of a variable in Python. It
    automatically detects the type.
  </p>
  <pre><code>x = 10      # Integer
  y = "Hello" # String
  z = 3.14    # Float</code></pre>

  <h2>9. Extensible and Embeddable</h2>
  <p>
    Python can be combined with other programming languages like C, C++, and
    Java to extend its functionality.
  </p>

  <h2>10. Supports GUI Programming</h2>
  <p>
    Python allows you to create Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) using libraries
    like Tkinter, PyQt, or Kivy.
  </p>
  <pre><code>from tkinter import *
  root = Tk()
  label = Label(root, text="Hello, Python GUI!")
  label.pack()
  root.mainloop()</code></pre>

  <h2>11. Used for Many Applications</h2>
  <p>Python is used in various fields, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Web Development (Django, Flask)</li>
    <li>Data Science (Pandas, NumPy)</li>
    <li>Machine Learning & AI (TensorFlow, Scikit-learn)</li>
    <li>Game Development (Pygame)</li>
    <li>Cybersecurity & Hacking (Kali Linux tools)</li>
  </ul>
  <pre><code>from flask import Flask
  app = Flask(__name__)
  
  @app.route("/")
  def home():
      return "Hello, Flask!"
  
  if __name__ == "__main__":
      app.run(debug=True)</code></pre>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    Python is a powerful, easy-to-learn, and flexible language with numerous
    features that make it suitable for beginners and experts. Whether you want
    to build websites, analyze data, or create games, Python has something for
    everyone!
