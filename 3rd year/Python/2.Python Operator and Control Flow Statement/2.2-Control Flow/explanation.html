    <h1>2.2 Control Flow</h1>
    <p>
      Control flow in Python refers to the order in which statements and instructions
      are executed in a program. By default, Python runs code line by line from top to bottom,
      but control flow statements allow us to make decisions, repeat actions, and jump to specific
      parts of the program based on conditions.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Types of Control Flow in Python</h2>
    <p>Python provides three main types of control flow statements:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Conditional Statements (Decision Making)</strong> – Used to make choices in a program
        (e.g., if, if-else, if-elif-else).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Loops (Iteration Statements)</strong> – Used to repeat a block of code multiple times
        (e.g., for loop, while loop).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Jump Statements</strong> – Used to control the flow inside loops (e.g., break, continue, pass).
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Why is Control Flow Important?</h2>
    <p>Control flow allows Python programs to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        ✅ Make decisions (e.g., Check if a user is eligible to vote).
      </li>
      <li>
        ✅ Repeat tasks efficiently (e.g., Print numbers from 1 to 10).
      </li>
      <li>
        ✅ Skip or exit loops when needed (e.g., Stop searching when a value is found).
      </li>
    </ul>
