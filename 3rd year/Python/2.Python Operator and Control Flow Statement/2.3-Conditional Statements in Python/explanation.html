  <h1>2.3 Conditional Statements in Python</h1>
  <p>
    Conditional statements in Python allow a program to make decisions based on
    conditions. These statements help the program execute different code blocks
    depending on whether a condition is True or False.
  </p>
  <p>Think of it like this:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>ðŸ‘‰ If it's raining, take an umbrella.</li>
    <li>ðŸ‘‰ If it's sunny, wear sunglasses.</li>
    <li>ðŸ‘‰ If the weather is cloudy, you may or may not take an umbrella.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    In Python, conditional statements work in the same wayâ€”making decisions
    based on conditions.
  </p>

  <h2>1. if Statement</h2>
  <p>
    The if statement allows a program to execute a block of code only if a
    certain condition is True.
  </p>
  <pre>
if condition:
    # Code to execute if condition is True</pre
  >
  <h3>Example 1: Checking if a number is positive</h3>
  <pre>
num = 10

if num > 0:
    print("The number is positive.")</pre
  >

  <h2>2. if â€¦ else Statement</h2>
  <p>The if â€¦ else statement allows two possibilities:</p>
  <pre>
if condition:
    # Code if condition is True
else:
    # Code if condition is False</pre
  >
  <h3>Example 2: Checking if a number is positive or negative</h3>
  <pre>
num = -5

if num > 0:
    print("The number is positive.")
else:
    print("The number is negative.")</pre
  >

  <h2>3. if â€¦ elif â€¦ else Statement</h2>
  <p>
    Sometimes, we have multiple conditions. Instead of writing multiple if
    statements, we use elif (short for else if) to check additional conditions.
  </p>
  <pre>
if condition1:
    # Code if condition1 is True
elif condition2:
    # Code if condition2 is True
else:
    # Code if none of the conditions are True</pre
  >
  <h3>Example 3: Checking if a number is positive, negative, or zero</h3>
  <pre>
num = 0

if num > 0:
    print("The number is positive.")
elif num < 0:
    print("The number is negative.")
else:
    print("The number is zero.")</pre
  >

  <h2>4. Nested if Statement</h2>
  <p>
    A nested if statement is when an if statement is placed inside another if
    statement.
  </p>
  <pre>
if condition1:
    if condition2:
        # Code if both conditions are True</pre
  >
  <h3>Example 4: Checking if a number is positive and even</h3>
  <pre>
num = 8

if num > 0:
    print("The number is positive.")

    if num % 2 == 0:
        print("It is also even.")</pre
  >

  <h2>Real-Life Example: Age Verification System</h2>
  <pre>
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

if age >= 18:
    print("You are eligible to vote.")
else:
    print("Sorry, you must be at least 18 years old to vote.")</pre
  >
