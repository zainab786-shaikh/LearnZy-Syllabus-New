    <h1>1.2 Segments of Environment</h1>
    
    <p>The environment is everything around us, including air, water, land, and living beings. It is made up of four main segments:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Atmosphere</strong> (Air)</li>
      <li><strong>Hydrosphere</strong> (Water)</li>
      <li><strong>Lithosphere</strong> (Land)</li>
      <li><strong>Biosphere</strong> (Life)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>1. Atmosphere ‚Äì The Air Around Us</h2>
    <p>The atmosphere is the layer of air that surrounds the Earth. It contains gases like oxygen (which we breathe), carbon dioxide (used by plants), and nitrogen.</p>
    <h3>Examples of Atmosphere:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>When we breathe, we take in oxygen from the atmosphere.</li>
      <li>Clouds and rain form in the atmosphere.</li>
      <li>Aeroplanes fly in the atmosphere.</li>
      <li>Birds and insects move through the atmosphere.</li>
      <li>The wind that we feel on our face is part of the atmosphere.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The atmosphere also protects us from harmful rays of the sun and keeps the Earth warm.</p>
    
    <h2>2. Hydrosphere ‚Äì The Water on Earth</h2>
    <p>The hydrosphere includes all the water bodies on Earth, such as oceans, rivers, lakes, and even underground water.</p>
    <h3>Examples of Hydrosphere:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The ocean is the largest part of the hydrosphere.</li>
      <li>Rivers like the Ganga, Nile, and Amazon flow through different countries.</li>
      <li>Lakes and ponds are small water bodies where fish and plants live.</li>
      <li>Rainfall is also part of the hydrosphere.</li>
      <li>The ice caps of Antarctica and glaciers are frozen water, but they still belong to the hydrosphere.</li>
      <li>Underground water (borewell or well water) that people use for drinking also comes from the hydrosphere.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Without water, life cannot exist. That‚Äôs why the hydrosphere is very important.</p>
    
    <h2>3. Lithosphere ‚Äì The Land We Live On</h2>
    <p>The lithosphere is the solid part of the Earth, including mountains, valleys, soil, rocks, and even the land where we build houses.</p>
    <h3>Examples of Lithosphere:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Mountains like the Himalayas and Alps are part of the lithosphere.</li>
      <li>Deserts like the Sahara are dry parts of the lithosphere.</li>
      <li>Forests, farmlands, and cities are all located on the lithosphere.</li>
      <li>Volcanoes come from the lithosphere when molten rock (lava) comes out.</li>
      <li>Sand, soil, and rocks are all part of the lithosphere.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The lithosphere provides us with soil for farming, minerals for industries, and land for living.</p>
    
    <h2>4. Biosphere ‚Äì The World of Living Beings</h2>
    <p>The biosphere includes all living things ‚Äì humans, animals, plants, and even tiny bacteria. It is where life exists, and it depends on the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and lithosphere for survival.</p>
    <h3>Examples of Biosphere:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Humans, animals, and plants all belong to the biosphere.</li>
      <li>Forests are full of life ‚Äì birds, insects, trees, and animals.</li>
      <li>Oceans have fish, whales, corals, and tiny microbes.</li>
      <li>Bacteria in the soil help plants grow.</li>
      <li>Bees and butterflies help in pollination.</li>
      <li>Even in extreme places like deep oceans and high mountains, life exists in the biosphere.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>How These Segments Are Connected</h2>
    <p>All four segments of the environment are connected. Here‚Äôs how:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A tree (biosphere) grows in the soil (lithosphere), takes in carbon dioxide from the air (atmosphere), and absorbs water from the rain (hydrosphere).</li>
      <li>Fish (biosphere) live in lakes and oceans (hydrosphere), which are affected by rainfall (atmosphere) and surrounded by land (lithosphere).</li>
      <li>Humans (biosphere) need oxygen (atmosphere), water (hydrosphere), and land (lithosphere) to survive.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The four segments of the environment ‚Äì Atmosphere, Hydrosphere, Lithosphere, and Biosphere ‚Äì work together to support life on Earth.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>The Atmosphere</strong> provides air.</li>
      <li><strong>The Hydrosphere</strong> provides water.</li>
      <li><strong>The Lithosphere</strong> provides land and resources.</li>
      <li><strong>The Biosphere</strong> is where life exists.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Without one of these, life would not be possible. Understanding these parts helps us protect nature and live in balance with our environment. üåç</p>
