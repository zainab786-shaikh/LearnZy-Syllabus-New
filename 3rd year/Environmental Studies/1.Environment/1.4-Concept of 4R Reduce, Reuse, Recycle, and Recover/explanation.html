    <h2>1.4 Concept of 4R: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, and Recover</h2>
    <p>The 4R concept is an important approach to waste management and environmental protection. It helps in reducing waste, conserving natural resources, and making the best use of available materials. The 4Rs stand for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Reduce</strong> – Minimizing waste generation</li>
      <li><strong>Reuse</strong> – Using items multiple times before discarding</li>
      <li><strong>Recycle</strong> – Converting waste materials into new products</li>
      <li><strong>Recover</strong> – Extracting useful resources from waste</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Let’s understand each concept in detail with simple examples.</p>
  
    <div class="concept">
      <h3>1. Reduce (Minimize Waste Generation)</h3>
      <p><strong>Meaning:</strong> "Reduce" means lowering the amount of waste we produce. If we use fewer resources, we will have less waste to deal with.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>✅ Carrying a cloth bag instead of using plastic bags while shopping.</li>
        <li>✅ Printing documents on both sides of paper to save paper.</li>
        <li>✅ Turning off lights and fans when not in use to save electricity.</li>
        <li>✅ Buying products with minimal packaging to reduce plastic waste.</li>
        <li>✅ Using a refillable water bottle instead of buying bottled water.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Why is it important?</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Decreases pollution.</li>
        <li>Saves natural resources like trees and water.</li>
        <li>Helps in reducing the load on landfills.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  
    <div class="concept">
      <h3>2. Reuse (Using Items Multiple Times)</h3>
      <p><strong>Meaning:</strong> "Reuse" means using the same product multiple times instead of throwing it away. It helps in extending the life of an item and reduces waste.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>✅ Using glass jars from jam or pickles to store spices or pulses.</li>
        <li>✅ Donating old clothes instead of throwing them away.</li>
        <li>✅ Using used paper for rough work before recycling it.</li>
        <li>✅ Repairing and using old furniture instead of buying new ones.</li>
        <li>✅ Using rechargeable batteries instead of disposable ones.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Why is it important?</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Saves money by reducing the need to buy new things.</li>
        <li>Reduces waste production.</li>
        <li>Helps in conserving raw materials used for manufacturing new products.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  
    <div class="concept">
      <h3>3. Recycle (Turning Waste into New Products)</h3>
      <p><strong>Meaning:</strong> "Recycle" means processing waste materials and turning them into new products. It helps in reducing pollution and conserving natural resources.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>✅ Plastic bottles can be recycled to make new plastic items like bags and containers.</li>
        <li>✅ Old newspapers can be recycled to make new paper products.</li>
        <li>✅ Used metal cans can be melted and used for making new cans or metal parts.</li>
        <li>✅ Glass bottles can be crushed and melted to make new glass products.</li>
        <li>✅ Electronic waste like old phones and computers can be recycled to extract useful metals like copper and gold.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Why is it important?</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reduces the need for new raw materials.</li>
        <li>Saves energy as recycling requires less energy than making products from scratch.</li>
        <li>Helps in reducing air, water, and soil pollution.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  
    <div class="concept">
      <h3>4. Recover (Extracting Useful Resources from Waste)</h3>
      <p><strong>Meaning:</strong> "Recover" means extracting useful energy or materials from waste before disposing of it. It is the last option before waste is thrown away in landfills.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>✅ <strong>Biogas production</strong> – Organic waste like food scraps and cow dung can be used to generate biogas for cooking and electricity.</li>
        <li>✅ <strong>Waste-to-energy plants</strong> – Some types of waste are burned to produce electricity.</li>
        <li>✅ <strong>Composting</strong> – Kitchen waste like fruit peels and vegetable scraps can be turned into compost, which is used as fertilizer for plants.</li>
        <li>✅ <strong>Metal recovery</strong> – Precious metals like gold and silver are extracted from old mobile phones and computers.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Why is it important?</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reduces waste going to landfills.</li>
        <li>Produces energy and other useful materials.</li>
        <li>Helps in waste management and resource conservation.</li>
      </ul>
