    <h2>1.3 Environmental Issues</h2>
    <p>The environment is our natural world, including air, water, soil, plants, and animals. Human activities often harm the environment, leading to problems such as pollution, climate change, and natural disasters. Here, we will discuss six major environmental issues in simple terms, with real-life examples.</p>
    
    <div class="issue">
      <h3>1. Greenhouse Effect</h3>
      <p>The greenhouse effect is a natural process that keeps our planet warm. Certain gases in the Earth's atmosphere, called greenhouse gases, trap heat from the sun.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Carbon dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ)</strong> ‚Äì Released from burning coal, oil, and gas.</li>
        <li><strong>Methane (CH‚ÇÑ)</strong> ‚Äì Comes from cattle farming, landfills, and rice fields.</li>
        <li><strong>Water vapor (H‚ÇÇO)</strong> ‚Äì Naturally present in the air.</li>
        <li><strong>Nitrous oxide (N‚ÇÇO)</strong> ‚Äì Released from fertilizers and burning fuel.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> Imagine sitting inside a car parked in the sun with windows closed. The inside of the car becomes very hot because the heat gets trapped. Similarly, greenhouse gases trap heat in Earth‚Äôs atmosphere, making the planet warmer.</p>

      <h3>2. Climate Change</h3>
      <p>Climate change means long-term changes in weather patterns due to excessive greenhouse gases, leading to extreme weather conditions like storms, droughts, and rising sea levels.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas)</li>
        <li>Deforestation (cutting down trees)</li>
        <li>Industrial pollution</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> Himalayan glaciers are melting, causing floods in rivers. Australia and California have frequent wildfires because of rising temperatures.</p>
    </div>
  
    <div class="issue">
      <h3>3. Global Warming</h3>
      <p>Global warming means the Earth is becoming hotter due to too many greenhouse gases.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ice caps and glaciers are melting.</li>
        <li>Sea levels are rising, flooding coastal cities.</li>
        <li>Many animals, like polar bears, are losing their natural habitat.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> The Arctic ice is melting, causing sea levels to rise and flooding islands like the Maldives.</p>
    </div>
  
    <div class="issue">
      <h3>4. Acid Rain</h3>
      <p>Acid rain is rain that contains harmful chemicals. When factories and vehicles release sulfur dioxide (SO‚ÇÇ) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), these gases mix with rainwater and turn into acid.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Harms crops and forests.</li>
        <li>Makes rivers and lakes too acidic for fish and aquatic life.</li>
        <li>Damages historical buildings like the Taj Mahal.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> The Taj Mahal in India is turning yellow due to acid rain from pollution.</p>
    </div>
  
    <div class="issue">
      <h3>5. Ozone Layer Depletion</h3>
      <p>The ozone layer is a protective shield that blocks harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun. Certain chemicals like CFCs (Chlorofluorocarbons) damage the ozone layer.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>CFCs used in refrigerators and air conditioners break ozone molecules.</li>
        <li>This creates a hole in the ozone layer.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> Scientists discovered a large ozone hole over Antarctica due to CFC pollution.</p>
    </div>
  
    <div class="issue">
      <h3>6. Nuclear Accidents</h3>
      <p>Nuclear power plants use radioactive materials to generate electricity. If an accident happens, harmful radiation can escape, causing serious health and environmental problems.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Chernobyl Disaster (1986) ‚Äì Ukraine:</strong> A nuclear explosion released dangerous radiation, making the area unlivable.</li>
        <li><strong>Fukushima Disaster (2011) ‚Äì Japan:</strong> A tsunami caused a nuclear plant explosion, releasing radiation into the air and ocean.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Effects:</strong> People exposed to radiation develop severe health problems like cancer. Land and water become contaminated for decades.</p>
    </div>
  
    <div class="conclusion">
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>Environmental issues like climate change, global warming, acid rain, ozone depletion, and nuclear accidents are serious problems caused mainly by human activities. If we don‚Äôt take action, these problems will get worse, affecting future generations.</p>
      <h4>How Can We Help?</h4>
