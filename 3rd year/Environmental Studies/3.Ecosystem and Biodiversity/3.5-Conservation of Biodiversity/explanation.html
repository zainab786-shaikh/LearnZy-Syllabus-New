    <h2>3.5 Conservation of Biodiversity</h2>
    <h3>What is Biodiversity?</h3>
    <p>Biodiversity means the variety of life on Earth. It includes different types of plants, animals, microorganisms, and ecosystems like forests, rivers, oceans, and deserts.</p>
    <p>Biodiversity is essential because:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>✅ It keeps nature balanced.</li>
      <li>✅ It provides food, medicine, and raw materials.</li>
      <li>✅ It helps in controlling climate and diseases.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>What is Conservation of Biodiversity?</h3>
    <p>Conservation of biodiversity means protecting and preserving plants, animals, and natural habitats. It ensures that future generations can enjoy and benefit from nature.</p>
    
    <h3>Objectives of Biodiversity Conservation</h3>
    <p>The main goal of conservation is to protect species and ecosystems while allowing sustainable use of natural resources. The objectives can be divided into three main types:</p>
    
    <h4>1. Preservation of Species</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>✔ Saving endangered species from extinction.</li>
      <li>✔ Protecting species that are on the verge of disappearing.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Bengal tiger in India is endangered, so the government has created reserves like Sundarbans Tiger Reserve to protect them.</li>
      <li>The Great Indian Bustard, a rare bird, is being protected in Rajasthan.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>2. Protection of Natural Habitats</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>✔ Safeguarding forests, wetlands, and other ecosystems where wildlife lives.</li>
      <li>✔ Preventing activities like deforestation, pollution, and land conversion.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Amazon Rainforest, known as the “lungs of the Earth,” is protected in many areas to prevent excessive deforestation.</li>
      <li>Kaziranga National Park in India protects one-horned rhinoceroses from poaching and habitat destruction.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>3. Sustainable Use of Resources</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>✔ Using natural resources wisely so they don’t get exhausted.</li>
      <li>✔ Encouraging eco-friendly practices like organic farming, renewable energy, and reforestation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sustainable fishing helps prevent overfishing in oceans.</li>
      <li>Agroforestry (growing trees along with crops) conserves soil and biodiversity.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Various Laws for Biodiversity Conservation</h3>
    <p>Different countries have made laws to protect biodiversity. In India, several laws and international agreements help in conservation.</p>
    
    <h4>1. Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 (India)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>✔ This law protects wild animals and plants from hunting and trade.</li>
      <li>✔ It creates national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, and reserves.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Hunting tigers is illegal under this law.</li>
      <li>Poachers caught smuggling elephant tusks can be jailed.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>2. Forest Conservation Act, 1980 (India)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>✔ Prevents deforestation and ensures forests are not destroyed for commercial use.</li>
      <li>✔ Requires special permission for cutting down forests.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If a company wants to build a factory in a forest, it needs government approval.</li>
      <li>Many forest areas are re-planted after cutting down trees.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>3. Biological Diversity Act, 2002 (India)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>✔ Protects Indian biological resources and prevents their misuse by foreign companies.</li>
      <li>✔ Encourages local communities to conserve biodiversity.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Foreign companies cannot patent Indian traditional medicinal plants like Neem, Turmeric, and Basmati rice.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>4. Environment Protection Act, 1986 (India)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>✔ Gives the government the power to take action against pollution and environmental damage.</li>
      <li>✔ Helps in protecting air, water, and land biodiversity.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Industries dumping waste in rivers can be fined or shut down.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>5. International Laws and Agreements</h4>
    <p>Several global agreements help in biodiversity conservation.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>(a) Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) – 1992</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>✔ Signed by 196 countries to protect biodiversity worldwide.</li>
          <li>✔ Encourages sustainable use of natural resources.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>(b) Ramsar Convention on Wetlands – 1971</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>✔ Protects important wetland areas that provide homes for birds, fish, and plants.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example: Chilika Lake in India is a Ramsar site that protects migratory birds.</p>
      </li>
      <li><strong>(c) CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) – 1973</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>✔ Bans the trade of endangered animals and plants.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example: Buying and selling ivory from elephants is illegal worldwide.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Ways We Can Help in Biodiversity Conservation</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>🌱 Plant more trees – Prevents deforestation and provides homes for animals.</li>
