    <h2>3.4 Threats to Biodiversity</h2>
    <p>There are several factors that pose a danger to biodiversity. These threats can lead to species extinction, habitat loss, and ecosystem destruction. Some of the major threats include:</p>
    
    <h3>1. Habitat Destruction</h3>
    <p>The most significant threat to biodiversity is the destruction of natural habitats. Forests, wetlands, coral reefs, and grasslands are being cleared for agriculture, urbanization, and industrialization.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> The Amazon Rainforest is being cut down at an alarming rate to make space for cattle ranching and farming.</p>
    
    <h3>2. Pollution</h3>
    <p>Pollution from industries, agriculture, and households affects air, water, and soil quality, harming plants and animals.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Plastic pollution in oceans kills marine animals like turtles, dolphins, and fish.</p>
    
    <h3>3. Climate Change</h3>
    <p>Global warming and unpredictable weather patterns affect ecosystems and species' survival. Rising temperatures cause ice caps to melt, endangering polar bears and penguins.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Coral bleaching occurs when corals lose their color and die due to warmer ocean temperatures.</p>
    
    <h3>4. Overexploitation of Resources</h3>
    <p>Excessive hunting, fishing, and logging can lead to species decline.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> The overhunting of the dodo bird led to its extinction. Overfishing in oceans is reducing fish populations, impacting marine food chains.</p>
    
    <h3>5. Invasive Species</h3>
    <p>When non-native species are introduced to a new environment, they may outcompete native species and disrupt ecosystems.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> The introduction of water hyacinth in Indian lakes and rivers has led to water pollution and the suffocation of aquatic life.</p>
    
    <h3>6. Deforestation</h3>
    <p>Large-scale clearing of forests for timber, agriculture, and settlements leads to habitat loss and global warming.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> The Sundarbans mangrove forests in India and Bangladesh are shrinking due to excessive tree cutting.</p>
    
    <h3>7. Industrial and Agricultural Expansion</h3>
    <p>Chemical fertilizers and pesticides used in farming harm soil, water, and wildlife.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Pesticides like DDT once harmed bird populations, including eagles and falcons, by weakening their eggshells.</p>
    
    <h2>Hotspots of Biodiversity</h2>
    <p>A biodiversity hotspot is a region that is rich in species diversity but is under severe threat due to human activities. To qualify as a biodiversity hotspot, a region must meet two criteria:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It must have at least 1,500 species of vascular plants as endemic species (species found nowhere else in the world).</li>
      <li>It must have lost at least 70% of its original natural vegetation due to human activities.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Examples of Biodiversity Hotspots in the World</h3>
    <p>There are 36 biodiversity hotspots globally. Some important ones include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Amazon Rainforest (South America)</strong> – The world’s largest tropical rainforest, home to jaguars, macaws, and thousands of plant species.</li>
      <li><strong>The Congo Basin (Africa)</strong> – A dense rainforest home to gorillas, chimpanzees, and rare plant species.</li>
      <li><strong>Sundaland (Southeast Asia)</strong> – Includes Indonesia, Malaysia, and surrounding areas with species like orangutans and tigers.</li>
      <li><strong>Madagascar (Africa)</strong> – An island with unique species such as lemurs found nowhere else.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Biodiversity Hotspots in India</h3>
    <p>India has four major biodiversity hotspots:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>The Himalayas</strong> – Includes the entire Indian Himalayan region and parts of neighboring countries. It is home to snow leopards, red pandas, and rhododendrons.</li>
      <li><strong>The Indo-Burma Region</strong> – Covers northeastern India, Myanmar, and surrounding countries. It has many endangered species like the one-horned rhinoceros.</li>
      <li><strong>The Western Ghats</strong> – A mountain range along the west coast of India, home to species like the Malabar civet and Nilgiri tahr.</li>
      <li><strong>The Sundaland (Including the Nicobar Islands)</strong> – Home to exotic species like the Nicobar pigeon and saltwater crocodiles.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Why Should We Protect Biodiversity?</h2>
    <p>Biodiversity is crucial because it:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>✔️ Provides food, medicine, and resources for survival.</li>
      <li>✔️ Maintains ecological balance and supports all life forms.</li>
      <li>✔️ Helps in climate regulation and disaster prevention.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>How Can We Protect Biodiversity?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Reduce deforestation and plant more trees.</li>
      <li>Avoid plastic and reduce pollution.</li>
      <li>Implement laws to protect endangered species.</li>
      <li>Promote sustainable farming and fishing practices.</li>
      <li>Raise awareness about the importance of biodiversity.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Biodiversity is essential for maintaining life on Earth, but it is under severe threat due to human activities. Protecting biodiversity hotspots and reducing environmental damage is necessary for a sustainable future. Through conservation efforts and responsible human actions, we can save our planet’s rich biodiversity.</p>
