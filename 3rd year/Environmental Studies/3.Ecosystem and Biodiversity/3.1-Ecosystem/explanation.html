    <h2>3.1 Ecosystem</h2>
  
    <h3>Definition of Ecosystem</h3>
    <p>An ecosystem is a system where living organisms (plants, animals, and microorganisms) interact with non-living components (air, water, soil, sunlight, temperature) in a specific environment. It is a natural unit that functions as a whole, supporting life.</p>
    <p><strong>üîπ Example:</strong> A forest is an ecosystem where trees, animals, birds, soil, water, and sunlight interact with each other. Similarly, a pond is an ecosystem where fish, algae, insects, and water exist together.</p>
  
    <h3>Aspects of an Ecosystem</h3>
  
    <h4>Biotic Components (Living things)</h4>
    <p>These are all the living organisms in an ecosystem.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Trees, flowers, grass, deer, tiger, birds, bacteria, insects.</p>
  
    <h4>Abiotic Components (Non-living things)</h4>
    <p>These are the physical and chemical elements in the ecosystem that support life.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Air, water, sunlight, temperature, soil, minerals, and nutrients.</p>
    <p><strong>üîπ Example:</strong> In a pond ecosystem, fish (biotic) live in water (abiotic), and they depend on oxygen, temperature, and sunlight for survival.</p>
  
    <h3>Division of Ecosystem</h3>
    <p>Ecosystems can be divided into different types based on their location and characteristics:</p>
  
    <h4>1. Natural Ecosystems</h4>
    <p>These exist in nature without human interference.</p>
    <p><strong>‚úÖ Examples:</strong></p>
  
    <h5>Terrestrial Ecosystems (Land-based)</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Forest Ecosystem (Trees, deer, tigers, monkeys, soil, sunlight)</li>
      <li>Grassland Ecosystem (Grass, cows, rabbits, insects, birds)</li>
      <li>Desert Ecosystem (Cactus, camels, snakes, sand, high temperature)</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h5>Aquatic Ecosystems (Water-based)</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Freshwater Ecosystem (Ponds, lakes, rivers ‚Äì fish, frogs, lotus)</li>
      <li>Marine Ecosystem (Oceans, seas ‚Äì whales, sharks, corals)</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h4>2. Artificial Ecosystems</h4>
    <p>These are man-made ecosystems where humans control the environment.</p>
    <p><strong>‚úÖ Examples:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Crop fields (Agricultural land) ‚Äì Farmers grow wheat, rice, or vegetables.</li>
      <li>Aquariums ‚Äì Artificially created environments for fish with plants and oxygen pumps.</li>
      <li>Zoos ‚Äì Animals are kept in a controlled environment for conservation or public display.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h3>General Characteristics of Ecosystem</h3>
  
    <h4>Self-Sustaining</h4>
    <p>Ecosystems can maintain themselves naturally.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> A forest can grow, provide food, and support animals without human help.</p>
  
    <h4>Energy Flow</h4>
    <p>Sunlight is the main source of energy, and it flows through plants, animals, and decomposers.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Sun ‚Üí Plants (photosynthesis) ‚Üí Deer (eats plants) ‚Üí Tiger (eats deer).</p>
  
    <h4>Food Chains and Food Webs</h4>
    <p>Organisms are linked through feeding relationships.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Grass ‚Üí Grasshopper ‚Üí Frog ‚Üí Snake ‚Üí Eagle.</p>
  
    <h4>Recycling of Nutrients</h4>
    <p>Elements like carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen cycle through the ecosystem.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Trees absorb carbon dioxide, give out oxygen, and when they decay, the nutrients go back into the soil.</p>
  
    <h4>Interdependence</h4>
    <p>All living and non-living things are connected and affect each other.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> If bees disappear, plants won‚Äôt get pollinated, and food production will decrease.</p>
  
    <h3>Functions of Ecosystem</h3>
  
    <h4>Energy Flow</h4>
    <p>The Sun provides energy to plants (producers), which is passed on to herbivores (plant-eaters) and then to carnivores (meat-eaters).</p>
  
    <h4>Nutrient Cycling</h4>
    <p>Essential elements like carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and water keep moving between living and non-living things.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> When leaves fall, they decompose and provide nutrients to the soil, helping new plants grow.</p>
  
    <h4>Balance of Gases</h4>
    <p>Plants absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen, which animals need for breathing.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> The Amazon rainforest is called the "lungs of the Earth" because it produces a lot of oxygen.</p>
  
    <h4>Waste Decomposition</h4>
    <p>Microorganisms like bacteria and fungi break down dead plants and animals, cleaning the environment.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> If a tree falls in a forest, decomposers turn it into nutrients for the soil.</p>
  
    <h4>Climate Regulation</h4>
    <p>Ecosystems help in maintaining temperature and controlling the climate.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Forests absorb carbon dioxide and prevent global warming.</p>
  
    <h4>Water Cycle</h4>
    <p>Ecosystems help in rain formation and maintain water balance.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Trees release water vapor, which forms clouds and brings rain.</p>
  
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>An ecosystem is a dynamic system where living beings and non-living components interact with each other. It maintains the balance of nature through energy flow, food chains, and recycling of nutrients. Whether natural (like forests and oceans) or artificial (like farms and aquariums), ecosystems are essential for life on Earth.</p>
    <p><strong>üí° Key takeaway:</strong> We must protect ecosystems by avoiding pollution, deforestation, and overuse of natural resources to keep our environment healthy! üåç‚ú®</p>
