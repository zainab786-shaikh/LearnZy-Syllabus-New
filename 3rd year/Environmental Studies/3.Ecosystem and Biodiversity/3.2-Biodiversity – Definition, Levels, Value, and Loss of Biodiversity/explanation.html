    <h2>3.2 Biodiversity – Definition, Levels, Value, and Loss of Biodiversity</h2>
    
    <h3>1. Definition of Biodiversity</h3>
    <p>Biodiversity (short for biological diversity) refers to the variety of life on Earth. It includes all living organisms, such as plants, animals, fungi, and microorganisms, as well as the ecosystems they form.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>A rainforest has a high biodiversity because it contains thousands of different species of trees, birds, insects, and mammals.</li>
      <li>A desert has lower biodiversity because fewer species can survive in the extreme conditions.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>2. Levels of Biodiversity</h3>
    <p>Biodiversity exists at three main levels:</p>
    
    <h4>A. Genetic Biodiversity (Diversity within a species)</h4>
    <p>Refers to differences in genes within the same species.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Different breeds of dogs (Labrador, German Shepherd, Pug) all belong to the same species but have different genetic traits.</li>
      <li>Different varieties of rice or wheat that farmers grow for different climates and soil types.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>B. Species Biodiversity (Diversity among species)</h4>
    <p>Refers to the variety of different species in a particular region or ecosystem.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>A coral reef contains hundreds of fish species, sea turtles, crabs, and corals.</li>
      <li>A city park may have fewer species, such as pigeons, squirrels, and a few trees.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>C. Ecosystem Biodiversity (Diversity of ecosystems)</h4>
    <p>Refers to the variety of different ecosystems or habitats found on Earth.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Amazon rainforest, Sahara Desert, and Arctic tundra all have different types of biodiversity.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>3. Value of Biodiversity</h3>
    <p>Biodiversity is important for many reasons.</p>
    
    <h4>A. Ecological Value</h4>
    <p>Each species plays a role in maintaining a healthy ecosystem.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Bees help in pollinating plants.</li>
      <li>Forests absorb carbon dioxide and produce oxygen.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>B. Economic Value</h4>
    <p>Many industries depend on biodiversity.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fishermen rely on fish for their livelihood.</li>
      <li>Many medicines come from plants.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>C. Aesthetic and Recreational Value</h4>
    <p>Nature’s beauty provides pleasure and tourism opportunities.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>National parks attract tourists.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>D. Ethical and Cultural Value</h4>
    <p>We must protect biodiversity because all species have the right to exist.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>In Hinduism, the cow is considered sacred.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>4. Loss of Biodiversity</h3>
    <p>Biodiversity is decreasing rapidly due to human activities.</p>
    
    <h4>A. Habitat Destruction</h4>
    <p>Deforestation and urbanization destroy natural habitats.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Amazon Rainforest destruction due to logging.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>B. Pollution</h4>
    <p>Water pollution, air pollution, and soil pollution harm biodiversity.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Oil spills kill marine life.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>C. Climate Change</h4>
    <p>Global warming affects biodiversity.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Coral reefs are dying due to rising sea temperatures.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>D. Overexploitation</h4>
    <p>Hunting, fishing, and mining are done at unsustainable levels.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Overfishing has led to the decline of fish populations.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>E. Invasive Species</h4>
    <p>When new species are introduced to an ecosystem, they can outcompete native species.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>The water hyacinth is choking water bodies.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>Biodiversity is essential for a healthy planet. It supports life, provides food, medicine, and clean air.</p>
    <p><strong>Ways to Protect Biodiversity:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Plant more trees</li>
      <li>Reduce pollution</li>
      <li>Protect wildlife</li>
      <li>Sustainable farming and fishing</li>
      <li>Support conservation programs</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By taking these steps, we can ensure that future generations enjoy the benefits of a diverse and thriving natural world.</p>
