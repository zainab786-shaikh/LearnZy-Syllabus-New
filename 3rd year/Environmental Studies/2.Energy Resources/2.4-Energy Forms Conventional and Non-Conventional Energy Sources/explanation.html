    <h1>2.4 Energy Forms: Conventional and Non-Conventional Energy Sources</h1>
    <p>Energy is essential for everything we do in our daily lives. From switching on a light bulb to driving a car, energy is needed everywhere. However, energy can come from different sources, which are broadly classified into Conventional Energy Sources and Non-Conventional Energy Sources.</p>
    
    <h2>1. Conventional Energy Sources</h2>
    <p>Conventional energy sources are those that have been used for a long time and are commonly found in nature. These sources are mostly non-renewable, meaning they take millions of years to form and cannot be replenished once used.</p>
    
    <h3>Examples of Conventional Energy Sources</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Coal</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Coal is a black or brownish rock that contains carbon.</li>
                <li>It is burned in power plants to generate electricity.</li>
                <li>Used in industries for heating and producing steel.</li>
                <li><strong>Example:</strong> Coal-fired power plants produce electricity for cities.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Petroleum (Oil)</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Found deep underground in the form of crude oil.</li>
                <li>Refined into petrol, diesel, and kerosene.</li>
                <li>Used in cars, airplanes, and industries.</li>
                <li><strong>Example:</strong> Petrol is used in cars and bikes for transportation.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Natural Gas</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>A cleaner fuel compared to coal and oil.</li>
                <li>Used for cooking in homes (LPG), generating electricity, and in industries.</li>
                <li><strong>Example:</strong> LPG cylinders used in kitchens contain natural gas.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Hydropower (Dams)</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Electricity generated from flowing water.</li>
                <li>Dams store water and release it through turbines to generate power.</li>
                <li><strong>Example:</strong> The Bhakra Nangal Dam in India generates hydroelectricity.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Nuclear Energy</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Energy produced from splitting atoms (nuclear fission).</li>
                <li>Highly powerful and used for large-scale electricity production.</li>
                <li><strong>Example:</strong> The Tarapur Nuclear Power Plant in India produces nuclear energy.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>2. Non-Conventional Energy Sources</h2>
    <p>Non-conventional energy sources are also called renewable energy sources because they are naturally replenished and never run out. These are considered environment-friendly as they do not cause pollution.</p>
    
    <h3>Examples of Non-Conventional Energy Sources</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Solar Energy</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The sun’s rays are converted into electricity using solar panels.</li>
                <li>Used in homes, industries, and even to power satellites.</li>
                <li><strong>Example:</strong> Solar water heaters and solar street lights work using sunlight.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Wind Energy</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Large windmills (or wind turbines) convert wind into electricity.</li>
                <li>Requires strong winds to generate power.</li>
                <li><strong>Example:</strong> Wind farms in Tamil Nadu and Gujarat produce electricity for nearby cities.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Geothermal Energy</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The heat from deep inside the Earth is used to produce electricity.</li>
                <li>Used in areas with volcanic activity or hot springs.</li>
                <li><strong>Example:</strong> The United States and Iceland use geothermal power to generate electricity.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Tidal Energy</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The rise and fall of ocean water (tides) are used to generate electricity.</li>
                <li>Special dams (barrages) are built to trap water during high tides and release it during low tides.</li>
                <li><strong>Example:</strong> The Kislaya Guba Tidal Power Station in Russia generates tidal energy.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Biomass Energy</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Uses plant and animal waste to generate energy.</li>
                <li>Biogas plants convert cow dung and kitchen waste into gas for cooking.</li>
                <li><strong>Example:</strong> Many villages in India use gobar gas plants to produce energy.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>To meet our energy needs, we have depended on conventional energy sources for a long time. However, these sources are limited and cause pollution. This is why the world is shifting towards non-conventional energy sources, which are cleaner, renewable, and sustainable for the future. By using solar panels, windmills, and biogas plants, we can reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and help protect our environment.</p>
