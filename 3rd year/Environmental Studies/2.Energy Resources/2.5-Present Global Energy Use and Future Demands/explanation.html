    <h2>2.5 Present Global Energy Use and Future Demands</h2>
    <p>
      Energy is essential for everything we do, from cooking food to running industries, powering homes, and transportation. As the world's population grows and technology advances, the demand for energy increases. In this topic, we will explore how energy is currently used worldwide, what types of energy sources we rely on, and how future demands will shape the way we produce and consume energy.
    </p>
  
    <h3>1. Present Global Energy Use</h3>
    
    <h4>A. Sources of Energy</h4>
    <p>Today, the world depends on different types of energy sources, which can be broadly classified into renewable and non-renewable energy sources.</p>
    
    <h5>1. Non-Renewable Energy Sources (Fossil Fuels)</h5>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Coal:</strong> Used for electricity generation in power plants.</li>
      <li><strong>Oil (Petroleum):</strong> Used for transportation (cars, airplanes), and manufacturing products like plastics.</li>
      <li><strong>Natural Gas:</strong> Used for heating homes and generating electricity.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Many countries, including the USA, China, and India, rely heavily on coal to generate electricity. In 2023, about 60% of global electricity came from fossil fuels.</p>
    
    <h5>2. Renewable Energy Sources</h5>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Solar Energy:</strong> Energy from the sun, used in solar panels.</li>
      <li><strong>Wind Energy:</strong> Energy from the wind, used in wind turbines.</li>
      <li><strong>Hydropower:</strong> Energy from flowing water, used in dams.</li>
      <li><strong>Geothermal Energy:</strong> Energy from the Earth's heat, used in power plants.</li>
      <li><strong>Biomass Energy:</strong> Energy from organic materials like wood, agricultural waste, and animal manure.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Countries like Norway and Brazil generate a large portion of their electricity using hydropower, reducing dependence on fossil fuels.</p>
  
    <h4>B. Sectors that Use Energy</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Industrial Sector:</strong> Factories use energy to manufacture goods like steel, cement, and chemicals.</li>
      <li><strong>Transportation Sector:</strong> Vehicles, airplanes, ships, and trains use energy.</li>
      <li><strong>Residential Sector:</strong> Homes use energy for lighting, cooking, heating, and cooling.</li>
      <li><strong>Commercial Sector:</strong> Offices, malls, hospitals, and schools require energy.</li>
      <li><strong>Agricultural Sector:</strong> Energy is needed for irrigation, tractors, and crop processing.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h3>2. Future Energy Demand</h3>
    
    <h4>A. Reasons for Increasing Energy Demand</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Population Growth:</strong> More people means more energy needed for homes, transportation, and industries.</li>
      <li><strong>Urbanization:</strong> More people moving to cities increases electricity demand.</li>
      <li><strong>Technological Advancements:</strong> Industries and digital technology require additional power.</li>
      <li><strong>Increase in Living Standards:</strong> More people use modern appliances and cars.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h3>3. Challenges in Meeting Future Energy Demand</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Depletion of Fossil Fuels:</strong> Oil, coal, and gas reserves will eventually run out.</li>
      <li><strong>Environmental Impact:</strong> Burning fossil fuels causes pollution and climate change.</li>
      <li><strong>Energy Inequality:</strong> Some regions have energy shortages.</li>
      <li><strong>Infrastructure Limitations:</strong> Some countries lack technology for energy production.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h3>4. Solutions for Sustainable Energy Future</h3>
  
    <h4>A. Transition to Renewable Energy</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Solar & Wind Farms:</strong> Expanding these can provide clean electricity.</li>
      <li><strong>Hydropower Projects:</strong> Dams can generate electricity without pollution.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h4>B. Energy Efficiency</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Smart Homes & Buildings:</strong> Using LED lights and energy-efficient appliances reduces consumption.</li>
      <li><strong>Electric Vehicles (EVs):</strong> Switching from petrol to electric cars reduces fuel consumption.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h4>C. Energy Conservation</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Public Transport:</strong> Encouraging buses, trains, and metros reduces energy use.</li>
      <li><strong>Recycling & Reducing Waste:</strong> Recycling materials saves energy.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      The world’s energy demand is rising, and we need to transition towards clean and renewable energy sources to sustain future generations. Governments, businesses, and individuals must work together to develop innovative solutions, improve efficiency, and reduce energy waste.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Final Thought:</strong> If we don’t shift towards cleaner energy, future generations might face energy shortages and severe climate changes. The choices we make today will determine the future of our planet!
