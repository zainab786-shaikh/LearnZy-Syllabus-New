    <h2>2.2 Renewable, Non-Renewable, and Cyclic Resources</h2>
    <p>
      Resources are things we get from nature to help us survive and improve our lives. They are classified into three types: Renewable, Non-Renewable, and Cyclic Resources.
    </p>
    
    <h3>1. Renewable Resources</h3>
    <p>These resources can be replenished naturally over time.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Solar Energy</strong> ‚Äì Unlimited energy from the sun for electricity and heating.</li>
      <li><strong>Wind Energy</strong> ‚Äì Wind turbines generate power.</li>
      <li><strong>Water (Hydropower)</strong> ‚Äì Flowing water generates electricity in dams.</li>
      <li><strong>Forests</strong> ‚Äì Trees regrow if planted properly.</li>
      <li><strong>Wildlife</strong> ‚Äì Animals and fish populations recover if managed well.</li>
      <li><strong>Agricultural Crops</strong> ‚Äì Crops like wheat and rice can be replanted.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Key Point:</strong> Renewable resources remain sustainable if used wisely.</p>
  
    <h3>2. Non-Renewable Resources</h3>
    <p>These resources take millions of years to form and cannot be replenished quickly.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Fossil Fuels:</strong> Coal (electricity), Petroleum (fuel, plastic), Natural Gas (cooking, heating).</li>
      <li><strong>Metals and Minerals:</strong> Gold, Silver, Copper (jewelry, electronics), Iron, Aluminum (buildings, vehicles).</li>
      <li><strong>Uranium:</strong> Used in nuclear power plants.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Key Point:</strong> Once used, non-renewable resources are gone forever.</p>
  
    <h3>3. Cyclic Resources</h3>
    <p>These resources can be reused after undergoing natural or artificial processes.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Water:</strong> Reused through the water cycle, wastewater purification.</li>
      <li><strong>Oxygen & CO‚ÇÇ:</strong> Maintained through photosynthesis and respiration.</li>
      <li><strong>Metals:</strong> Iron, Aluminum, and Copper can be recycled.</li>
      <li><strong>Paper & Plastic:</strong> Can be processed and reused.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Key Point:</strong> Cyclic resources reduce waste and conserve materials.</p>
    
    <h3>Comparison of Resources</h3>

        <tr>
          <th>Type of Resource</th>
          <th>Can it be Replenished?</th>

          <td>Renewable</td>
          <td>Yes</td>
          <td>Sunlight, Wind, Water, Forests</td>
          <td>Needs proper management.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Non-Renewable</td>
          <td>No</td>
          <td>Coal, Oil, Natural Gas, Gold</td>
          <td>Cannot be replaced in our lifetime.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Cyclic</td>
          <td>Can be reused</td>
          <td>Water, Oxygen, Metals</td>
          <td>Helps in conservation.</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  
    <h3>Why is This Important?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Wise use of resources prevents wastage.</li>
      <li>Focusing on renewable and cyclic resources protects the environment.</li>
      <li>Reducing dependence on non-renewable resources avoids depletion.</li>
      <li>Recycling and sustainable practices ensure resources for future generations.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      Resources are essential for life. We must use them responsibly: renewable resources should be managed well, non-renewable resources should be conserved, and cyclic resources should be reused efficiently. This helps protect our planet. üåçüíö
