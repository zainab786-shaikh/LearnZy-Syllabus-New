    <h2>2.1 Natural Resources</h2>
  
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      Natural resources are things we get from nature that help us survive and improve our lives. These include forests, water, minerals, land, and energy sources.
      We use them for food, shelter, energy, and industrial purposes.
    </p>
  
    <h3>Types of Natural Resources</h3>
    <p>Natural resources can be divided into two main types:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Renewable Resources</strong> – These can be naturally replaced over time (e.g., sunlight, water, forests).</li>
      <li><strong>Non-Renewable Resources</strong> – These take millions of years to form and can run out if overused (e.g., coal, petroleum, minerals).</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h3>1. Forest Resources</h3>
    <p>Forests are large areas covered with trees, plants, and wildlife. They provide oxygen, food, shelter, and raw materials for industries.</p>
    <h4>Uses of Forests:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Oxygen Production – Trees absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen.</li>
      <li>Timber and Wood – Used for furniture, paper, and houses.</li>
      <li>Medicine – Many medicinal plants come from forests (e.g., Neem, Aloe Vera).</li>
      <li>Wildlife Habitat – Forests are home to animals like tigers, elephants, and deer.</li>
      <li>Climate Control – Trees help regulate temperature and rainfall.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Examples of Forests:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Amazon Rainforest (South America) – The largest tropical rainforest.</li>
      <li>Sundarbans (India & Bangladesh) – Known for mangrove trees and Royal Bengal Tigers.</li>
      <li>Black Forest (Germany) – Famous for its dense tree cover and scenic beauty.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Threats to Forests:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Deforestation – Cutting down trees for agriculture and urbanization.</li>
      <li>Forest Fires – Natural or human-caused fires destroy trees.</li>
      <li>Illegal Logging – Trees are cut down without permission.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h3>2. Water Resources</h3>
    <p>Water is essential for life. It covers about 71% of the Earth's surface, but only 3% is freshwater.</p>
    <h4>Uses of Water:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Drinking and Cooking – Essential for human survival.</li>
      <li>Agriculture – Used for irrigation to grow crops.</li>
      <li>Industry – Used in factories for cooling and manufacturing.</li>
      <li>Hydropower – Electricity generation from dams.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Sources of Water:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Rivers – Ganga, Nile, Amazon.</li>
      <li>Lakes – Caspian Sea, Dal Lake.</li>
      <li>Oceans and Seas – Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean.</li>
      <li>Groundwater – Water stored under the earth’s surface.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Threats to Water Resources:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Pollution – Chemicals and waste dumped into rivers and lakes.</li>
      <li>Overuse – Excessive use in agriculture and industries.</li>
      <li>Climate Change – Reduces rainfall and causes droughts.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h3>3. Energy Resources</h3>
    <p>Energy resources generate power for industries, transportation, and households. They are divided into:</p>
    <h4>Renewable Energy:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Solar Energy – Energy from the sun.</li>
      <li>Wind Energy – Wind turbines generate electricity.</li>
      <li>Hydropower – Water from dams generates electricity.</li>
      <li>Geothermal Energy – Heat from the Earth’s surface.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Non-Renewable Energy:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Coal – Used in power plants.</li>
      <li>Petroleum (Oil & Gas) – Used in vehicles and industries.</li>
      <li>Natural Gas – Used in cooking and heating.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Examples of Energy Use:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Solar panels on rooftops to generate electricity.</li>
      <li>Wind farms in Gujarat and Tamil Nadu, India.</li>
      <li>The Three Gorges Dam in China producing hydropower.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Threats to Energy Resources:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Overconsumption – Using too much fossil fuel leads to shortages.</li>
      <li>Pollution – Burning coal and oil causes air pollution.</li>
      <li>Climate Change – Excessive use of fossil fuels leads to global warming.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h3>4. Land Resources</h3>
    <p>Land is used for agriculture, construction, industries, and forests. Good quality land is needed to grow food and support human life.</p>
    <h4>Uses of Land:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Agriculture – Growing crops and raising animals.</li>
      <li>Housing and Infrastructure – Buildings, roads, and factories.</li>
