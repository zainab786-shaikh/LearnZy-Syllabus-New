    <h2>5.3 Management Measures</h2>
    <p>Management measures refer to the steps taken to protect and manage natural resources like water, land, and energy in a sustainable way. These measures help in conserving the environment while ensuring that resources are available for future generations.</p>
    
    <h3>1. Rainwater Harvesting (RWH)</h3>
    <p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>
    <p>Rainwater Harvesting is the process of collecting and storing rainwater for future use instead of letting it run off. This water can be used for drinking, irrigation, and recharging groundwater.</p>
    
    <h4>Methods of Rainwater Harvesting:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Rooftop Rainwater Harvesting – Rainwater from rooftops is collected in tanks or directed into the ground.</li>
      <li>Surface Runoff Harvesting – Water from streets, gardens, and other surfaces is collected and stored.</li>
      <li>Recharge Pits & Wells – Water is allowed to seep underground to refill groundwater.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Examples:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>✅ Chennai has made rainwater harvesting compulsory for buildings, leading to an increase in groundwater levels.</li>
      <li>✅ Rajasthan’s Johads (traditional ponds) store rainwater for drinking and irrigation in dry areas.</li>
      <li>✅ In Bangalore, apartments store rooftop rainwater and use it for gardening and washing.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Benefits:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>✔ Saves water for future use.</li>
      <li>✔ Reduces flooding.</li>
      <li>✔ Helps in areas with water shortages.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>2. Groundwater Recharge</h3>
    <p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>
    <p>Groundwater Recharge is the process of refilling underground water by allowing rainwater to seep into the ground. This helps prevent water depletion.</p>
    
    <h4>Methods of Groundwater Recharge:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Recharge Wells & Pits – Rainwater is diverted into deep pits to seep into the soil.</li>
      <li>Percolation Tanks – Large tanks are used to hold water so it slowly seeps underground.</li>
      <li>Check Dams – Small dams are built on rivers to slow down water flow and allow water to seep into the ground.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Examples:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>✅ In Gujarat, the Sardar Patel Participatory Water Conservation project has created check dams to recharge groundwater.</li>
      <li>✅ Punjab and Haryana farmers build recharge pits to improve underground water levels.</li>
      <li>✅ Delhi Metro uses recharge wells at stations to refill groundwater.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Benefits:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>✔ Increases water availability.</li>
      <li>✔ Reduces dependence on borewells.</li>
      <li>✔ Prevents land sinking due to overuse of groundwater.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>3. Green Belt Development</h3>
    <p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>
    <p>Green Belt Development means planting trees and vegetation in and around cities, industries, and roads to improve the environment. It acts as a natural filter for air pollution and helps in reducing heat.</p>
    
    <h4>Examples:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>✅ Delhi’s Ridge Forest helps in controlling air pollution.</li>
      <li>✅ Mumbai's Aarey Forest is a green belt that absorbs carbon dioxide.</li>
      <li>✅ Chandigarh’s green cover makes the city cooler and cleaner.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Benefits:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>✔ Reduces pollution.</li>
      <li>✔ Provides shade and cools the area.</li>
      <li>✔ Prevents soil erosion and floods.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>4. Use of Renewable Energy</h3>
    <p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>
    <p>Renewable energy comes from natural sources that never run out, like the sun, wind, and water. Using renewable energy reduces pollution and saves fossil fuels.</p>
    
    <h4>Types of Renewable Energy:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Solar Energy – Using sunlight to generate electricity.</li>
      <li>Wind Energy – Using wind turbines to produce power.</li>
      <li>Hydro Energy – Generating electricity from flowing water.</li>
      <li>Biogas – Using organic waste to produce energy.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Examples:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>✅ India’s Bhadla Solar Park (Rajasthan) is one of the world’s largest solar farms.</li>
      <li>✅ Tamil Nadu’s Muppandal Wind Farm generates wind energy for thousands of homes.</li>
      <li>✅ Tehri Dam (Uttarakhand) produces hydroelectricity for multiple states.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Benefits:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>✔ Reduces pollution.</li>
      <li>✔ Saves non-renewable resources like coal and oil.</li>
      <li>✔ Lowers electricity costs in the long run.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>5. Watershed Management</h3>
    <p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>
    <p>A watershed is an area where all water drains into a common point like a river or lake. Watershed management involves protecting and managing land and water resources in these areas.</p>
    
    <h4>Methods of Watershed Management:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Afforestation (Planting Trees) – Prevents soil erosion and improves water retention.</li>
      <li>Building Small Check Dams – Slows down water flow and increases groundwater recharge.</li>
      <li>Contour Farming – Farmers plow across slopes to stop water runoff.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Examples:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>✅ Sukhomajri Project (Haryana) restored forests and water bodies using watershed techniques.</li>
      <li>✅ Hiware Bazar (Maharashtra) became a model village by implementing watershed management.</li>
      <li>✅ Karnataka’s Watershed Projects have improved irrigation in dry areas.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Benefits:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>✔ Prevents floods and droughts.</li>
      <li>✔ Increases crop productivity.</li>
      <li>✔ Improves soil and water quality.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>These management measures are essential for environmental protection and sustainable resource use...</p>
