    <h1>4.4 Wastewater - Generation, Impacts, Treatment, and CPCB Norms</h1>
  
    <h2>1. What is Wastewater?</h2>
    <p>Wastewater is used water that is no longer clean and needs treatment before being released back into the environment. It may contain chemicals, human waste, food particles, oils, and industrial pollutants.</p>
    <p>It comes from two main sources:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Domestic wastewater</strong> (from households)</li>
      <li><strong>Industrial wastewater</strong> (from factories and industries)</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h2>2. Generation of Wastewater</h2>
    
    <h3>A. Domestic Wastewater</h3>
    <p>This is wastewater generated from homes, offices, schools, and public places. It includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Toilet water (sewage)</strong> ‚Äì human waste, urine, and toilet flush water.</li>
      <li><strong>Kitchen waste</strong> ‚Äì leftover food, oils, and detergents.</li>
      <li><strong>Laundry water</strong> ‚Äì soap, dirt, and chemicals from washing clothes.</li>
      <li><strong>Bathroom water</strong> ‚Äì water from bathing, shampoo, and soap residues.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> When you wash dishes, the soapy water mixed with food particles flows down the drain into a sewage system. This is a form of domestic wastewater.</p>
  
    <h3>B. Industrial Wastewater</h3>
    <p>This is wastewater produced by factories and industries. It contains harmful chemicals, heavy metals, and toxic substances.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Textile industry</strong> ‚Äì dyes, chemicals, and fabric residues.</li>
      <li><strong>Paper industry</strong> ‚Äì chemicals used in bleaching and pulping.</li>
      <li><strong>Oil refineries</strong> ‚Äì petroleum waste, oils, and grease.</li>
      <li><strong>Chemical plants</strong> ‚Äì acids, alkalis, and hazardous chemicals.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> A chemical factory producing paints releases wastewater containing toxins and colorants that can be harmful if not treated.</p>
  
    <h2>3. Impacts of Wastewater</h2>
    <h3>A. Impact on the Environment</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Water Pollution</strong> ‚Äì Rivers, lakes, and oceans get contaminated.</li>
      <li><strong>Soil Degradation</strong> ‚Äì Toxic waste damages farmland and soil fertility.</li>
      <li><strong>Air Pollution</strong> ‚Äì Some wastewater releases gases like ammonia and methane.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> The Yamuna River in India has become heavily polluted due to untreated sewage and industrial waste, making the water unfit for drinking.</p>
    
    <h3>B. Impact on Human Health</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Drinking contaminated water causes diseases like cholera, dysentery, and typhoid.</li>
      <li>Toxic chemicals in wastewater cause skin diseases, respiratory issues, and even cancer.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Villages near industrial areas often face skin diseases and stomach infections due to polluted water.</p>
  
    <h2>4. Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) - Flow Diagram</h2>
    <p>A Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) is a facility where wastewater is cleaned before being discharged. It removes solid waste, harmful chemicals, and bacteria.</p>
    <h3>Flow Diagram of Sewage Treatment Plant</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Screening:</strong> Large objects (plastic, paper, stones) are removed using screens.</li>
      <li><strong>Grit Removal:</strong> Sand, gravel, and small stones settle at the bottom.</li>
      <li><strong>Primary Treatment:</strong> Heavy solid waste (sludge) settles down, and floating grease is removed.</li>
      <li><strong>Secondary Treatment:</strong> Microorganisms (bacteria) break down organic waste in aeration tanks.</li>
      <li><strong>Tertiary Treatment:</strong> Chemical treatment removes harmful bacteria, and the water is disinfected.</li>
      <li><strong>Final Discharge:</strong> Cleaned water is released into rivers or used for irrigation.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> A sewage treatment plant in Mumbai treats millions of liters of wastewater daily before discharging it safely into the sea.</p>
  
    <h2>5. CPCB Norms for Sewage Discharge</h2>
    <p>The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in India has set strict rules for releasing wastewater into rivers or land.</p>
    <h3>Main CPCB Guidelines</h3>
    <table border="1">
      <tr>
        <th>Parameter</th>
        <th>Permissible Limit</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>pH (Acidity/Alkalinity)</td>
        <td>6.5 ‚Äì 9.0</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)</td>
        <td>&lt; 30 mg/L</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)</td>
        <td>&lt; 250 mg/L</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Total Suspended Solids (TSS)</td>
        <td>&lt; 100 mg/L</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Oil & Grease</td>
        <td>&lt; 10 mg/L</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Fecal Coliform (Bacteria)</td>
        <td>&lt; 1000 MPN/100mL</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> A food processing factory must treat its wastewater to remove oil, grease, and bacteria before releasing it into the river.</p>
  
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Wastewater is generated from households and industries.</li>
      <li>If untreated, it harms the environment and human health.</li>
      <li>Sewage Treatment Plants (STP) clean wastewater before discharge.</li>
      <li>CPCB has strict limits to prevent pollution.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By treating wastewater properly, we can protect nature, save water, and prevent diseases! üö∞üíßüåç</p>
