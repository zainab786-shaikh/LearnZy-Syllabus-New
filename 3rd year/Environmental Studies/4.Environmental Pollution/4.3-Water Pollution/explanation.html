    <h2>4.3 Water Pollution</h2>
    
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Water is essential for all living beings on Earth. However, when harmful substances like chemicals, waste, and microorganisms enter water bodies, it leads to water pollution. This makes water unsafe for drinking, bathing, farming, and other activities.</p>
    
    <h3>Sources of Water</h3>
    <p>Water is available in two main forms:</p>
    <h4>1. Surface Water</h4>
    <p>Surface water is found on the Earthâ€™s surface in sources like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Rivers (e.g., Ganga, Yamuna, Nile)</li>
      <li>Lakes (e.g., Dal Lake, Victoria Lake)</li>
      <li>Ponds (e.g., small village ponds)</li>
      <li>Oceans and Seas (e.g., Pacific Ocean, Arabian Sea)</li>
      <li>Reservoirs and Dams (e.g., Bhakra Nangal Dam, Hoover Dam)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>2. Sub-Surface Water (Groundwater)</h4>
    <p>This type of water is found below the Earth's surface. It includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Wells (e.g., Hand pumps in villages)</li>
      <li>Springs (e.g., Natural geysers)</li>
      <li>Aquifers (Underground water stored in porous rocks)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Sources of Water Pollution</h3>
    <p>Water pollution happens when harmful substances enter water bodies. The major sources are:</p>
    
    <h4>1. Natural Sources</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Volcanic Eruptions - Ash and toxic gases mix with rainwater.</li>
      <li>Soil Erosion - Sand and mud make water muddy.</li>
      <li>Algae Growth - Some algae release toxins into water bodies.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>2. Human-Made Sources</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Industrial Waste - Factories release chemicals like mercury and lead into rivers.</li>
      <li>Agricultural Runoff - Pesticides and fertilizers from farms get washed into water bodies.</li>
      <li>Domestic Waste - Sewage, detergents, and garbage from households.</li>
      <li>Plastic Pollution - Bottles, bags, and microplastics harm marine life.</li>
      <li>Oil Spills - Leakage from oil tankers in oceans (e.g., Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010).</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Effects of Water Pollution</h3>
    
    <h4>1. Effects on the Environment</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Aquatic Life Destruction - Fish and plants die due to toxins.</li>
      <li>Eutrophication - Excess nutrients cause excessive algae growth, blocking sunlight.</li>
      <li>Loss of Biodiversity - Polluted water kills species dependent on clean water.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>2. Effects on Human Health</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Waterborne Diseases - Cholera, typhoid, and dysentery spread due to dirty water.</li>
      <li>Poisoning - Chemicals like lead and arsenic cause serious health issues.</li>
      <li>Skin and Eye Infections - Direct contact with polluted water can cause rashes and irritation.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Preventive Measures</h3>
    <h4>1. Individual Actions</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Avoid dumping plastic and garbage into water bodies.</li>
      <li>Use biodegradable detergents and organic fertilizers.</li>
      <li>Conserve water by fixing leaks and using it efficiently.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>2. Government and Industrial Actions</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Implement strict pollution control laws for industries.</li>
      <li>Improve sewage treatment plants.</li>
      <li>Promote eco-friendly farming practices.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>BIS / Water Quality Standards</h3>
    <p>The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) sets water quality guidelines to ensure safe drinking water. Important parameters include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>pH Level (6.5 - 8.5) - Measures acidity.</li>
      <li>Dissolved Oxygen (Above 5 mg/L) - Required for aquatic life.</li>
      <li>Turbidity (Below 5 NTU) - Measures water clarity.</li>
      <li>Heavy Metals (e.g., Lead should be less than 0.01 mg/L).</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Flow Diagram of Water Treatment Plant</h3>
    <p>A water treatment plant cleans polluted water before supplying it to homes. The process includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Screening - Removes large objects like leaves and plastic.</li>
      <li>Coagulation & Flocculation - Chemicals are added to make dirt particles stick together.</li>
      <li>Sedimentation - Heavy particles settle at the bottom.</li>
      <li>Filtration - Water passes through sand and charcoal to remove smaller impurities.</li>
      <li>Disinfection - Chlorine or UV light kills bacteria and viruses.</li>
      <li>Storage & Distribution - Clean water is stored and supplied to households.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Water Conservation</h3>
    <p>Saving water is essential to prevent shortages. Some ways to conserve water include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Rainwater Harvesting - Collect and store rainwater for reuse.</li>
      <li>Drip Irrigation - Saves water in agriculture by delivering it directly to roots.</li>
      <li>Fixing Leaks - A dripping tap wastes liters of water daily.</li>
      <li>Recycling Wastewater - Treated wastewater can be used for gardening and flushing toilets.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>Water pollution is a serious issue that affects all living beings. By taking simple actions at home and ensuring industries follow environmental rules, we can protect our water sources for future generations.</p>
