    <h1>1.7 Managerial Skills – Detailed Explanation with Examples</h1>
    <p>
      Managerial skills are the abilities that a manager must have to effectively lead and control an organization. 
      These skills help managers perform their duties successfully and ensure that employees work efficiently toward achieving organizational goals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Management expert Robert Katz categorized managerial skills into three main types:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Technical Skills</li>
      <li>Human (Interpersonal) Skills</li>
      <li>Conceptual Skills</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Let’s understand each of these skills with simple explanations and examples.</p>
  
    <h2>1. Technical Skills</h2>
    <h3>Definition</h3>
    <p>
      Technical skills refer to the ability to use specific knowledge, tools, techniques, and methods required to perform a particular job. 
      These skills are more important for lower-level managers (such as supervisors) because they work closely with employees.
    </p>
  
    <h3>Examples of Technical Skills</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A software manager should know programming languages like Java or Python.</li>
      <li>A factory supervisor should know how machines operate.</li>
      <li>A chef in a restaurant should know cooking techniques.</li>
      <li>A finance manager should understand accounting principles and financial analysis.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h3>Simple Example</h3>
    <p>
      Imagine a restaurant kitchen. The head chef (manager) must know how to cook different dishes, 
      use kitchen equipment, and train junior chefs. This technical expertise helps maintain food quality and service.
    </p>
  
    <h2>2. Human (Interpersonal) Skills</h2>
    <h3>Definition</h3>
    <p>
      Human skills involve the ability to interact, communicate, and work well with people. A manager must understand 
      employees’ needs, motivate them, and resolve conflicts to ensure a positive work environment.
    </p>
  
    <h3>Examples of Human Skills</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A team leader motivating employees to work harder.</li>
      <li>A customer service manager handling customer complaints.</li>
      <li>A school principal resolving conflicts between teachers.</li>
      <li>A manager building teamwork and ensuring good communication among employees.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h3>Simple Example</h3>
    <p>
      Imagine a football coach. A good coach does not just teach players how to kick a ball but also ensures they work 
      together as a team, resolve conflicts, and stay motivated. Similarly, a manager needs human skills to keep the team united and productive.
    </p>
  
    <h2>3. Conceptual Skills</h2>
    <h3>Definition</h3>
    <p>
      Conceptual skills refer to the ability to think creatively, analyze situations, and make strategic decisions for the future. 
      These skills are most important for top-level managers who plan and make policies for the organization.
    </p>
  
    <h3>Examples of Conceptual Skills</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A CEO planning a new business expansion.</li>
      <li>A hospital director deciding to introduce new healthcare services.</li>
      <li>A government official making policies to improve the economy.</li>
      <li>A business owner analyzing competitors and future market trends.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h3>Simple Example</h3>
    <p>
      Imagine a company selling mobile phones. The CEO must think about:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Future market trends (Will people prefer foldable phones?)</li>
      <li>Competition (What are Samsung and Apple doing?)</li>
      <li>Company growth (Should we launch a budget-friendly smartphone?)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These long-term decisions require conceptual skills to ensure the company stays ahead of competitors.
    </p>
  
    <h2>Importance of Managerial Skills</h2>
    <p>A manager must balance all three skills:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Lower-level managers (e.g., supervisors) need more technical skills because they work directly with employees.</li>
      <li>Middle-level managers (e.g., department heads) need more human skills to coordinate between employees and top management.</li>
      <li>Top-level managers (e.g., CEOs) need strong conceptual skills for decision-making and strategic planning.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h3>Final Example</h3>
    <p>Think of a hospital:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A junior doctor (technical skills) knows how to diagnose and treat patients.</li>
      <li>A hospital administrator (human skills) ensures staff cooperation and patient satisfaction.</li>
      <li>The hospital director (conceptual skills) plans for future healthcare services and investments.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <p>
      By mastering all three skills, a manager can successfully lead an organization toward success.
