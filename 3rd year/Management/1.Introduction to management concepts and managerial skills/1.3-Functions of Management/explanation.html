    <h1>1.3 Functions of Management</h1>
    <p>Management is essential in any organization, whether it's a small business, a large corporation, or even a school. It ensures that work is done efficiently and goals are achieved. There are five main functions of management:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Planning</li>
      <li>Organizing</li>
      <li>Leading/Directing</li>
      <li>Staffing</li>
      <li>Controlling</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Let's understand each function in simple terms with examples.</p>
    
    <h2>1. Planning</h2>
    <p><strong>Meaning:</strong> Planning is the first and most important function of management. It involves thinking ahead and deciding what needs to be done, how it should be done, and when it should be done. It helps in setting goals and making strategies to achieve them.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Imagine you want to start a restaurant. Before opening it, you need to plan:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>What type of food you will serve (Indian, Chinese, Fast food, etc.).</li>
        <li>Where your restaurant will be located.</li>
        <li>How much money you need to invest.</li>
        <li>How many workers you will hire.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Real-life Example:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>A school principal plans the academic year by deciding:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>The syllabus for each class.</li>
        <li>The schedule for exams and holidays.</li>
        <li>The number of teachers required.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>2. Organizing</h2>
    <p><strong>Meaning:</strong> Organizing means arranging everything in a systematic way so that work can be done smoothly. It involves distributing tasks, assigning responsibilities, and ensuring that resources (money, staff, materials) are used efficiently.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>In a restaurant, organizing includes:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Assigning chefs to cook food.</li>
        <li>Hiring waiters to serve customers.</li>
        <li>Setting up the kitchen with proper equipment.</li>
        <li>Arranging tables and chairs for customers.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Real-life Example:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>A cricket team organizes itself by:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Assigning roles (batsman, bowler, wicketkeeper).</li>
        <li>Ensuring everyone practices regularly.</li>
        <li>Managing equipment like bats, balls, and kits.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>3. Leading/Directing</h2>
    <p><strong>Meaning:</strong> Leading (or Directing) means guiding and motivating employees to work efficiently. A manager should communicate clearly, inspire workers, and solve problems to keep the team motivated.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>In a restaurant, the manager must:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Guide the chefs to maintain food quality.</li>
        <li>Motivate waiters to provide good service.</li>
        <li>Solve customer complaints quickly.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Real-life Example:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>A football coach directs the players by:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Encouraging them before a match.</li>
        <li>Giving instructions during the game.</li>
        <li>Correcting mistakes and suggesting improvements.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>4. Staffing</h2>
    <p><strong>Meaning:</strong> Staffing means hiring the right people for the right jobs and ensuring they work effectively. It includes recruitment, training, and maintaining a good work environment.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>In a restaurant, staffing involves:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Hiring skilled chefs and waiters.</li>
        <li>Providing training to improve service.</li>
        <li>Ensuring workers get proper salaries and rest breaks.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Real-life Example:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>A hospital needs proper staffing:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Hiring qualified doctors and nurses.</li>
        <li>Training staff in emergency procedures.</li>
        <li>Ensuring enough workers are available for different shifts.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>5. Controlling</h2>
    <p><strong>Meaning:</strong> Controlling ensures that everything goes as planned. If mistakes happen, corrective actions should be taken immediately. Managers compare actual performance with planned goals and make necessary changes.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>In a restaurant, controlling includes:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Checking if food quality is maintained.</li>
        <li>Ensuring customers receive timely service.</li>
        <li>Monitoring expenses to avoid losses.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Real-life Example:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>In a school, controlling is done by:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Checking if teachers complete the syllabus on time.</li>
        <li>Ensuring students perform well in exams.</li>
        <li>Identifying weak students and providing extra help.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
