    <h1>2.2 Planning Activities, Detailing, and Following Each Step</h1>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Planning is an essential part of any process, whether it is a small task like organizing an event or a large project like developing a mobile app. Without proper planning, tasks can become confusing, inefficient, and time-consuming.</p>
    <p>This topic focuses on how to plan activities, detail each step, and follow them correctly to achieve the desired results.</p>
    
    <h2>1. What is Planning?</h2>
    <p>Planning means thinking in advance about what needs to be done, how it will be done, and in what order. It helps in organizing tasks effectively so that they are completed successfully.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Imagine you are organizing a birthday party. If you donâ€™t plan, things might go wrongâ€”guests may not get invitations on time, the food may not be enough, or decorations may be missing. But if you plan properly, you can ensure everything goes smoothly.</p>
    
    <h2>2. Steps in Planning Activities</h2>
    
    <h3>Step 1: Identify the Goal (What Needs to Be Done?)</h3>
    <p>Before starting any activity, the first step is to identify what needs to be achieved.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> If you want to build a mobile app for online food delivery, your goal is: "Develop an app that allows users to order food from restaurants easily."</p>
    
    <h3>Step 2: Gather Requirements (What is Needed?)</h3>
    <p>After defining the goal, the next step is to find out what resources, tools, and people are required to complete the task.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> For the food delivery app, you may need:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A development team (programmers, designers)</li>
      <li>A list of restaurants</li>
      <li>A payment system</li>
      <li>A database for storing orders</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Step 3: Break the Task into Smaller Steps</h3>
    <p>Once you know what you need, divide the task into smaller, manageable steps.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> For a birthday party, the steps could be:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Create a guest list</li>
      <li>Send invitations</li>
      <li>Book a venue</li>
      <li>Order food</li>
      <li>Arrange decorations</li>
      <li>Organize entertainment</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Step 4: Assign Responsibilities</h3>
    <p>In many activities, multiple people work together. Itâ€™s important to assign who will do what to avoid confusion.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> In a wedding preparation, tasks can be divided as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>One person handles guest invitations</li>
      <li>Another arranges the food</li>
      <li>Another takes care of decorations</li>
      <li>Someone books the venue</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Step 5: Set a Timeline (When Should Each Task Be Completed?)</h3>
    <p>Setting deadlines helps in keeping track of progress.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> For an exam preparation plan:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Monday: Study Chapter 1 & 2</li>
      <li>Tuesday: Study Chapter 3 & 4</li>
      <li>Wednesday: Revise all chapters</li>
      <li>Thursday: Solve past question papers</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Step 6: Follow the Plan (Execution Phase)</h3>
    <p>After planning, it is important to follow the steps properly to complete the task as per schedule.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> If you are renovating your house, and you planned to first paint the walls before installing new furniture, you should stick to that order to avoid mistakes.</p>
    
    <h3>Step 7: Monitor Progress and Make Adjustments</h3>
    <p>Sometimes things donâ€™t go as planned. Itâ€™s important to check progress regularly and make adjustments if needed.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> If a caterer cancels at the last moment, you should quickly find a new one to keep the event on track.</p>
    
    <h3>Step 8: Review and Improve</h3>
    <p>After completing the task, review the whole process to learn from mistakes and improve for the future.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> After hosting a corporate event, you can ask for feedback to improve future events.</p>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Planning is essential in all areas of lifeâ€”be it personal tasks, business projects, or software development.</p>
