    <h1>2.6 Matching Human Needs with Job Needs</h1>
    <p>Every worker has different skills, abilities, and interests. A good supervisor ensures that employees are assigned tasks that match their capabilities while also considering their personal needs.</p>
    
    <h2>Key Aspects:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Job Suitability</strong> â€“ Assigning tasks based on skills and qualifications.</li>
      <li><strong>Employee Satisfaction</strong> â€“ Ensuring employees feel comfortable and motivated.</li>
      <li><strong>Work-Life Balance</strong> â€“ Providing fair working hours and proper rest.</li>
      <li><strong>Training & Development</strong> â€“ Offering learning opportunities to improve skills.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Example:</h2>
    <h3>ðŸ”¹ In a software company:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A tech-savvy employee who enjoys coding is assigned programming tasks.</li>
      <li>A person with good communication skills is given customer support duties.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>ðŸ”¹ In a hospital:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A highly experienced nurse is assigned critical patient care.</li>
      <li>A junior nurse is given basic duties with proper training.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>If an employee is forced to do work they are not skilled at or interested in, productivity decreases, and job satisfaction goes down.</p>
