    <h1>3.5 Controlling Methods</h1>
    <p>Managers use different methods to control performance in an organization. These methods focus on quality, quantity, time, and cost.</p>
  
    <h2>1. Controlling Quality</h2>
    <p>Quality control ensures that the product or service meets the required standard.</p>
    <p><strong>ðŸ‘‰ Example:</strong></p>
    <p>A company manufacturing soft drinks checks if every bottle has the right amount of liquid and is properly sealed. If any bottle is underfilled, it is rejected.</p>
  
    <h2>2. Controlling Quantity of Production</h2>
    <p>Quantity control ensures that production meets the required target.</p>
    <p><strong>ðŸ‘‰ Example:</strong></p>
    <p>A bakery must produce 1,000 loaves of bread daily. If only 800 loaves are made, the supervisor must increase efficiency by adjusting working hours or using better equipment.</p>
  
    <h2>3. Controlling Time (Timely Completion of Work)</h2>
    <p>Time control ensures that tasks are completed on schedule.</p>
    <p><strong>ðŸ‘‰ Example:</strong></p>
    <p>A courier company promises 24-hour delivery. If deliveries take more than 24 hours, the manager may investigate delays and change the route planning.</p>
  
    <h2>4. Controlling Cost</h2>
    <p>Cost control ensures that expenses remain within the budget.</p>
    <p><strong>ðŸ‘‰ Example:</strong></p>
    <p>A hotel sets a budget of â‚¹500 per meal. If the cost rises to â‚¹600, the supervisor must find ways to reduce waste or buy cheaper ingredients.</p>
  
    <h2>Measuring Performance, Comparing with Standards, and Correcting Deviations</h2>
    <p>To maintain high performance, managers follow these three steps:</p>
  
    <h3>Measuring Performance</h3>
    <p>Checking output, quality, time taken, or cost spent.</p>
    <p><strong>ðŸ‘‰ Example:</strong> A bank tracks how many loans an employee processes daily.</p>
  
    <h3>Comparing with Standards</h3>
    <p>Checking if performance meets the required standard.</p>
    <p><strong>ðŸ‘‰ Example:</strong> If an employee should process 20 loans per day but only processes 15, performance is below standard.</p>
  
    <h3>Correcting Deviations</h3>
    <p>Taking action to fix mistakes.</p>
    <p><strong>ðŸ‘‰ Example:</strong> The bank may introduce faster software or train employees to improve loan processing speed.</p>
  
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Controlling at the supervisory level ensures that employees meet their targets in quality, quantity, time, and cost. By monitoring performance, comparing results with standards, and taking corrective action, managers ensure smooth operations and customer satisfaction.</p>
