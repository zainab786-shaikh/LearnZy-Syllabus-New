    <h2>3.4 Managerial Control</h2>
    <h3>Understanding Teams and the Link Between Various Departments</h3>
    <p>Every company has multiple departments, such as production, sales, finance, human resources, and customer service. For an organization to function smoothly, all these departments must work together.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>A mobile phone manufacturing company has:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>A design team that creates the phone model.</li>
        <li>A production team that assembles the phone.</li>
        <li>A quality control team that checks if the phone meets standards.</li>
        <li>A sales team that markets and sells the phone.</li>
        <li>A customer service team that handles complaints.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>If the quality control team finds defects in the phone, they must inform the production team to fix them before selling. This link between departments ensures quality products and customer satisfaction.</p>
    
    <h3>Process and Quality Standards</h3>
    <p>Every company sets standards to maintain quality and efficiency. These standards define how products or services should be delivered.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>A fast-food chain like McDonald's has strict standards:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>A burger must be made in 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>The temperature of the patty must be at least 70Â°C.</li>
        <li>Customer waiting time should not exceed 3 minutes.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>If employees fail to meet these standards, the supervisor must take corrective action.</p>
    
    <h3>Steps in the Control Process</h3>
    <p>The control process has four main steps:</p>
    
    <h4>1. Setting Performance Standards</h4>
    <p>A standard is a benchmark that employees must follow. It can be related to quality, quantity, cost, or time.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>A car manufacturing company may set a standard that:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>A worker must assemble 10 car engines per day.</li>
        <li>The rejection rate (defective products) should be less than 2%.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>2. Measuring Performance</h4>
    <p>The next step is to track actual performance and see if employees are meeting the set standards.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>A supervisor in a call center checks how many calls each agent attends in a day and whether they resolve customer issues.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>3. Comparing Performance with Standards</h4>
    <p>After measuring performance, managers compare the results with the set standards.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>If the target is 10 car engines per day and a worker makes only 7, there is a shortfall.</li>
      <li>If a call center expects agents to solve 90% of customer complaints but they solve only 75%, performance is low.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>4. Correcting Unfavorable Deviations</h4>
    <p>If actual performance is below the standard, corrective action is needed.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>If a worker assembles only 7 car engines instead of 10, the supervisor may provide training or add more workers.</li>
      <li>If a call center agent is not solving complaints properly, they may receive extra coaching.</li>
    </ul>
