    <h2>3.3 Elaborating Decisions and Laying Disciplinary Standards in Overall Working</h2>
    
    <h3>Making Decisions Clear</h3>
    <p>A supervisor must explain the reasons behind their decisions so that employees understand their importance and follow them willingly.</p>
    
    <h3>Laying Disciplinary Standards</h3>
    <p>Every workplace has rules that employees must follow. A supervisor ensures that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Employees come to work on time.</li>
      <li>Work is done as per company guidelines.</li>
      <li>There is no misconduct like stealing, dishonesty, or poor behavior.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Example:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>In a call center, if an employee speaks rudely to a customer, the supervisor must explain the company’s customer service rules and take disciplinary action if needed.</li>
      <li>In a hospital, nurses must follow strict hygiene rules. If someone doesn’t, the supervisor must correct them immediately to ensure patient safety.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>Directing at the supervisory level is about guiding employees properly, predicting and preventing mistakes, and ensuring discipline in the workplace.</p>
    <p>A good supervisor communicates clearly, supports employees, and enforces company rules effectively.</p>
