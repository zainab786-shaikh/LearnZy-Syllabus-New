    <h1>3.1 Needs for Directions and Instructions to Subordinates</h1>
  
    <h2>Why Do Employees Need Directions and Instructions?</h2>
    <p>
      Employees need clear directions and instructions to work efficiently. If instructions are unclear, employees may get confused, leading to mistakes, delays, or poor performance.
    </p>
  
    <h2>Important Aspects of Giving Directions</h2>
  
    <h3>Clarity</h3>
    <p>The supervisor must communicate clearly so that employees understand what needs to be done.</p>
  
    <h3>Completeness</h3>
    <p>Instructions should cover all necessary details to avoid confusion.</p>
  
    <h3>Feasibility</h3>
    <p>Instructions should be practical and realistic to implement.</p>
  
    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>Imagine a factory where workers assemble mobile phones. The supervisor must:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Clearly explain how to assemble each part.</li>
      <li>Ensure workers know the safety rules.</li>
      <li>Give step-by-step guidance to new workers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If instructions are incomplete, workers may assemble parts incorrectly, leading to defective products.</p>
