    <h1>5.2 Industrial Acts</h1>
    <p>Industrial Acts are laws made to protect workers’ rights and regulate industries. These laws ensure that workers get fair wages, safe working conditions, and protection from unfair treatment. Let’s understand four important Industrial Acts in India.</p>
  
    <h2>(a) Indian Factory Act, 1948</h2>
    <p>The Indian Factory Act was introduced to ensure the safety, health, and welfare of workers in factories. It applies to factories where 10 or more workers are employed (if power is used) or 20 or more workers (if power is not used).</p>
  
    <h3>Main Provisions:</h3>
    <h4>Working Hours:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Adults cannot work more than 48 hours per week.</li>
      <li>They must get a weekly holiday (usually Sunday).</li>
      <li>Daily working hours cannot exceed 9 hours.</li>
      <li>Overtime wages should be double the regular wages.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h4>Health & Safety:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Factories must provide clean drinking water and proper ventilation.</li>
      <li>Workers must get safety measures like fire protection, emergency exits, and protective gear.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h4>Child & Female Workers:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Children below 14 years cannot work in factories.</li>
      <li>Women cannot be made to work between 7 PM and 6 AM.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h4>Example:</h4>
    <p>A factory making textiles in Mumbai has 200 workers. The factory owner must ensure proper lighting, ventilation, and drinking water for workers. Also, if a worker works more than 9 hours, they must be paid double wages for overtime.</p>
  
    <h2>(b) Industrial Dispute Act, 1947</h2>
    <p>The Industrial Dispute Act was passed to resolve conflicts between workers and employers. It helps in settling disputes related to wages, layoffs, work conditions, and termination of employees.</p>
  
    <h3>Main Provisions:</h3>
    <h4>Settlement of Disputes:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>If a dispute arises between workers and the employer, it should be settled through negotiations, conciliation officers, labor courts, or tribunals.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h4>Strikes & Lockouts:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Workers have the right to strike, but they must give a notice of 6 weeks before striking.</li>
      <li>Employers cannot declare a lockout without prior notice.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h4>Retrenchment (Job Cut) Rules:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>If a company removes workers due to financial losses, it must give at least one month's notice or pay in advance.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h4>Example:</h4>
    <p>A car manufacturing company lays off 50 workers due to a decline in sales. As per the Industrial Dispute Act, the company must inform the workers and compensate them before termination.</p>
  
    <h2>(c) Workman Compensation Act, 1923</h2>
    <p>The Workman Compensation Act ensures that if a worker gets injured, disabled, or dies while working, the employer must provide compensation.</p>
  
    <h3>Main Provisions:</h3>
    <h4>Employer’s Responsibility:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>If a worker gets injured or disabled at work, the employer must pay compensation to them or their family.</li>
      <li>If a worker dies due to a workplace accident, their family should get financial compensation.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h4>Types of Compensation:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Permanent Disability:</strong> A worker who loses a body part (e.g., hand, leg, or eyesight) should get lifelong compensation.</li>
      <li><strong>Temporary Disability:</strong> If a worker is injured but can recover, they must receive a salary until they can work again.</li>
      <li><strong>Death Compensation:</strong> If a worker dies in an accident, the employer must pay financial support to the worker’s family.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h4>Example:</h4>
    <p>A construction worker falls from a building while working and gets a spinal injury. He is unable to work again. Under the Workman Compensation Act, his employer must pay him compensation for life to support him and his family.</p>
  
    <h2>(d) Minimum Wages Act, 1948</h2>
    <p>The Minimum Wages Act ensures that every worker gets a fair salary. This prevents employers from exploiting workers by paying them very low wages.</p>
  
    <h3>Main Provisions:</h3>
    <h4>Fixing of Minimum Wages:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>The government sets minimum wages for different jobs and industries.</li>
      <li>Employers must not pay less than this amount.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h4>Overtime Pay:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>If a worker works extra hours, they should be paid twice the normal rate.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h4>Timely Payment:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Workers must get their salary on time, either weekly or monthly.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h4>Example:</h4>
    <p>A restaurant worker in Delhi is paid ₹200 per day. The government’s minimum wage for such workers is ₹400 per day. The restaurant owner must increase the salary to ₹400 as per the Minimum Wages Act.</p>
  
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>These Industrial Acts protect workers’ rights, ensuring they get fair wages, a safe workplace, and job security. Employers must follow these laws to create a healthy and lawful work environment.</p>
