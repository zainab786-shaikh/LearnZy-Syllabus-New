    <h2>What are Fire Hazards?</h2>
    <p>A fire hazard is anything that can start a fire, make it spread, or cause harm due to fire. Fire hazards are dangerous because they can lead to property damage, injuries, or even loss of life.</p>

    <h2>Types of Fire Hazards</h2>
    
    <h3>Flammable Materials</h3>
    <p>Objects that can easily catch fire, like paper, wood, gasoline, or alcohol.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> A pile of newspapers near a stove can catch fire if exposed to heat.</p>

    <h3>Electrical Hazards</h3>
    <p>Faulty wiring, overloaded circuits, or damaged electrical appliances can cause fires.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> A short circuit in a faulty extension cord can cause sparks and start a fire.</p>

    <h3>Improper Handling of Fire</h3>
    <p>Leaving stoves, candles, or fireplaces unattended.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> A burning candle left near a curtain can cause a house fire.</p>

    <h3>Gas Leaks</h3>
    <p>Leaks from LPG cylinders or gas pipelines can cause explosions.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> A gas leak in the kitchen can ignite when a match is lit.</p>

    <h3>Blocked Fire Exits</h3>
    <p>Fire exit doors or staircases blocked by furniture, boxes, or trash.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> In case of a fire, if a door is blocked, people cannot escape safely.</p>

    <h3>Improper Storage of Chemicals</h3>
    <p>Storing chemicals like paint, fuel, or cleaning solutions near heat sources.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> A bottle of paint thinner kept near a heater can catch fire easily.</p>

    <h2>What is a Fire Drill?</h2>
    <p>A fire drill is a practice session where people learn how to react safely in case of a fire emergency. It helps in preparing individuals to evacuate quickly and efficiently.</p>

    <h3>Purpose of a Fire Drill</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ensure Safety</strong> â€“ Helps people understand how to escape safely.</li>

    <p><strong>Example:</strong> If a trash can is on fire, a trained person can use an extinguisher to stop it.</p>

    <h4>Assemble at a Safe Location</h4>
    <p>A pre-decided meeting point should be used.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> In a school, students gather in the playground after evacuation.</p>
