    <h2>4.2 General Safety Norms for an Industrial Unit & Preventive Measures</h2>
    
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Industrial units, such as factories, warehouses, and manufacturing plants, involve various processes that can be hazardous if not managed properly. To ensure the safety of workers, machines, and the environment, every industrial unit follows certain safety norms (rules) and preventive measures (steps taken to avoid accidents).</p>
    <p>These safety norms are designed to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Protect workers from injuries</li>
      <li>Prevent damage to equipment</li>
      <li>Ensure a safe and healthy working environment</li>
      <li>Reduce the risk of accidents like fire, explosions, chemical spills, etc.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>4.2 General Safety Norms for an Industrial Unit</h3>
    <h4>1. Use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)</h4>
    <p>Workers must wear appropriate safety gear while working in hazardous areas.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Helmets ‚Äì To protect the head from falling objects.</li>
      <li>Gloves ‚Äì To prevent cuts and burns.</li>
      <li>Safety Shoes ‚Äì To protect feet from heavy objects and electrical shocks.</li>
      <li>Goggles ‚Äì To protect eyes from dust, chemicals, or sparks.</li>
      <li>Ear Protection ‚Äì For workers in noisy environments like metal cutting or grinding areas.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Real-Life Example:</strong> In a welding factory, workers wear safety glasses and gloves to protect themselves from sparks and high temperatures.</p>
    
    <h4>2. Proper Machine Handling and Maintenance</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Machines should have emergency stop buttons.</li>
      <li>Workers should not operate heavy machinery without proper training.</li>
      <li>Lubrication and maintenance of moving parts should be done regularly to avoid breakdowns.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Real-Life Example:</strong> If a conveyor belt in a factory is not maintained, it might suddenly stop or move erratically, leading to accidents.</p>
    
    <h4>3. Fire Safety Measures</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Fire extinguishers and sprinklers should be installed.</li>
      <li>Fire exits should be clearly marked and always accessible.</li>
      <li>Flammable materials should be stored properly.</li>
      <li>Workers should be trained in using fire extinguishers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Real-Life Example:</strong> A textile factory caught fire due to a short circuit, but because fire extinguishers were installed, the fire was quickly controlled, preventing damage.</p>
    
    <h4>4. Proper Ventilation and Air Quality Control</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Exhaust fans and air filters should be installed in chemical plants.</li>
      <li>Workers handling toxic gases should wear respiratory masks.</li>
      <li>Work areas should have fresh air circulation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Real-Life Example:</strong> In a paint factory, workers wear masks, and the area has exhaust systems to remove harmful fumes.</p>
    
    <h4>5. Safe Electrical Installations</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Wires should be properly insulated and maintained.</li>
      <li>Overloaded circuits should be avoided.</li>
      <li>Electrical panels should be labeled and accessible only to authorized persons.</li>
      <li>Workers should not handle electrical equipment with wet hands.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Real-Life Example:</strong> A metal factory faced an electrical short circuit, but since all the electrical equipment was well-maintained, no fire broke out.</p>
    
    <h4>6. Emergency Preparedness and First Aid</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>First aid kits should be available in every department.</li>
      <li>Workers should be trained in first aid and CPR.</li>
      <li>Emergency drills should be conducted regularly.</li>
      <li>Emergency contact numbers should be displayed clearly.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Real-Life Example:</strong> A worker in a factory got a deep cut while using a sharp tool. Since a first aid kit was available, the bleeding was controlled before taking him to the hospital.</p>
    
    <h4>7. Proper Storage and Handling of Hazardous Materials</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Chemicals should be stored in labeled containers.</li>
      <li>Workers handling hazardous materials should wear protective gear.</li>
      <li>Safety Data Sheets (SDS) should be available for every chemical.</li>
      <li>Dangerous substances should be kept away from fire sources.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Real-Life Example:</strong> In a pharmaceutical plant, chemical containers were stored in ventilated areas with proper labels, reducing the risk of accidental exposure.</p>
    
    <h3>Preventive Measures to Avoid Accidents</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Conduct Regular Safety Audits</strong> ‚Äì Inspect the workplace regularly to find and fix potential hazards.</li>
      <li><strong>Provide Safety Training to Workers</strong> ‚Äì Workers should be educated on how to handle machines, chemicals, and emergency situations.</li>
      <li><strong>Install Safety Signage</strong> ‚Äì Warning signs should be placed in dangerous areas.</li>
      <li><strong>Enforce Safety Rules Strictly</strong> ‚Äì Strict rules should be followed regarding PPE, machine usage, and hazardous materials.</li>
      <li><strong>Use Automation Where Possible</strong> ‚Äì Automation can reduce human involvement in risky tasks.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>Industrial safety norms and preventive measures are essential to protect workers and the environment. By following these guidelines, industries can prevent accidents, reduce risks, and ensure a safe working environment.</p>
    <p>A safe workplace leads to higher productivity, fewer injuries, and better employee morale. Industries should always prioritize safety first! üößüë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüî•</p>
