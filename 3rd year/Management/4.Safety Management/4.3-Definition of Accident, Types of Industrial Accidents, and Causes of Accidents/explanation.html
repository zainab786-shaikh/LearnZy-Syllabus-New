    <h1>4.3 Definition of Accident, Types of Industrial Accidents, and Causes of Accidents</h1>
  
    <h2>Definition of an Accident</h2>
    <p>An accident is an unexpected or unplanned event that causes harm, injury, damage, or even death. Accidents can happen anywhere, such as at home, on the road, or in industries.</p>
  
    <h3>Example:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A worker in a factory slips on a wet floor and falls.</li>
      <li>A machine operator gets his hand caught in a moving machine part.</li>
      <li>A construction worker falls from a scaffold while working on a building.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In industrial settings, accidents are unwanted events that cause injury, property damage, or production loss.</p>
  
    <h2>Types of Industrial Accidents</h2>
    <p>Industrial accidents occur in workplaces such as factories, construction sites, warehouses, and power plants. These accidents can be classified into different types:</p>
  
    <h3>1. Mechanical Accidents</h3>
    <p>These accidents occur due to machinery or equipment failure.</p>
    <h4>Example:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>A worker’s hand gets caught in a machine’s moving parts.</li>
      <li>A conveyor belt malfunctions and hits an employee.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h3>2. Electrical Accidents</h3>
    <p>These accidents happen due to faulty wiring, electric shocks, or equipment failure.</p>
    <h4>Example:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>An electrician gets an electric shock while repairing a circuit.</li>
      <li>A worker touches a live wire and suffers burns.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h3>3. Fire and Explosion Accidents</h3>
    <p>These accidents occur due to flammable materials, gas leaks, or unsafe handling of chemicals.</p>
    <h4>Example:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>A gas cylinder explodes in a welding workshop.</li>
      <li>A short circuit causes a fire in a factory.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h3>4. Chemical Accidents</h3>
    <p>These occur when hazardous chemicals cause burns, poisoning, or respiratory problems.</p>
    <h4>Example:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>A worker inhales toxic fumes from a chemical spill.</li>
      <li>Acid splashes on a worker’s hand, causing burns.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h3>5. Slips, Trips, and Falls</h3>
    <p>These accidents happen when workers fall due to slippery surfaces or obstacles.</p>
    <h4>Example:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>A worker slips on an oily floor and breaks his leg.</li>
      <li>A worker trips over a wire and falls, hitting his head.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h3>6. Falling Objects Accidents</h3>
    <p>Accidents caused by objects falling from heights.</p>
    <h4>Example:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>A brick falls from a building under construction and injures a worker.</li>
      <li>A heavy tool falls from a shelf and hits a worker’s foot.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h3>7. Confined Space Accidents</h3>
    <p>These occur when workers are trapped in small spaces with low oxygen levels.</p>
    <h4>Example:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>A worker suffocates while working in a storage tank.</li>
      <li>A person gets stuck inside a sewer line and loses consciousness.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h2>Causes of Industrial Accidents</h2>
    <p>Accidents can happen due to several reasons, which are classified into three main categories:</p>
  
    <h3>1. Human Causes (Unsafe Acts)</h3>
    <p>These accidents occur due to workers' mistakes, negligence, or lack of training.</p>
    <h4>Examples:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Not wearing safety gear (helmets, gloves, goggles).</li>
      <li>Using a machine without proper knowledge.</li>
      <li>Talking on the phone while working with heavy machinery.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h3>2. Mechanical Causes (Unsafe Equipment or Machinery Failure)</h3>
    <p>Accidents caused by faulty equipment or machinery issues.</p>
    <h4>Examples:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>A machine suddenly stops working and injures a worker.</li>
      <li>A cutting tool breaks and injures a nearby worker.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h3>3. Environmental Causes (Unsafe Workplace Conditions)</h3>
    <p>Accidents caused by hazardous workplace conditions.</p>
    <h4>Examples:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Poor lighting, making it difficult for workers to see properly.</li>
      <li>Slippery floors causing workers to fall.</li>
      <li>Excessive noise leading to hearing problems.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Industrial accidents are unpredictable but preventable. Companies should provide safety training, maintain machines properly, and follow safety rules to reduce accidents.</p>
