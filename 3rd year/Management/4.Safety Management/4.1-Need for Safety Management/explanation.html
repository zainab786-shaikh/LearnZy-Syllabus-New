    <h3>What is Safety Management?</h3>
    <p>Safety management is the process of identifying, analyzing, and controlling risks to prevent accidents, injuries, or harm in workplaces, public spaces, and daily life. It includes planning, rules, and actions to ensure the safety of people, property, and the environment.</p>
    
    <h3>Why is Safety Management Important?</h3>
    <p>Safety management is necessary to prevent accidents, protect lives, and ensure smooth operations in different industries. Without proper safety measures, businesses and workplaces may face serious consequences, including injuries, deaths, legal actions, and financial losses.</p>
    
    <h3>Key Reasons for Safety Management</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Prevention of Accidents and Injuries</strong>
        <p>Example: In a construction site, workers wear helmets and safety harnesses to prevent falls and head injuries. Without these measures, serious accidents can happen.</p>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Protection of Human Life</strong>
        <p>Example: In hospitals, doctors and nurses follow hygiene and safety protocols to prevent the spread of infections.</p>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Legal Compliance</strong>
        <p>Governments have strict safety laws that companies must follow.</p>
        <p>Example: Factories must install fire extinguishers and emergency exits to comply with fire safety regulations.</p>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Reduction of Financial Losses</strong>
        <p>Accidents lead to medical expenses, legal penalties, and damaged property.</p>
        <p>Example: A company that ignores machine maintenance may face costly repairs and compensation for injured workers.</p>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Improvement in Productivity</strong>
        <p>Safe workplaces help employees feel secure and work more efficiently.</p>
        <p>Example: A factory with clear safety instructions and protective gear reduces downtime due to injuries.</p>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Environmental Protection</strong>
        <p>Industries dealing with chemicals must follow safety rules to avoid pollution and health risks.</p>
        <p>Example: Oil companies must have spill management plans to prevent environmental disasters.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Examples of Safety Management in Different Sectors</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Workplace Safety</strong>
        <p>Offices: Fire drills, emergency exits, and ergonomic furniture to prevent health issues.</p>
        <p>Factories: Machine guards, helmets, gloves, and eye protection for workers.</p>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Transportation Safety</strong>
        <p>Traffic rules, seat belts, airbags, and speed limits prevent road accidents.</p>
        <p>Airlines follow strict safety checks before flights to avoid crashes.</p>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Home Safety</strong>
        <p>Installing smoke detectors and fire extinguishers in homes to prevent fires.</p>
        <p>Keeping medicines and sharp objects out of childrenâ€™s reach.</p>
      </li>

        <p>Hospitals ensure proper disposal of medical waste to prevent infections.</p>
        <p>Doctors use sterilized tools to protect patients from bacteria.</p>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Cyber Safety</strong>
        <p>Using strong passwords and security software to prevent hacking and data theft.</p>
        <p>Educating people about phishing scams to avoid online fraud.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
