    <h1>2.1 Different Services of Operating System</h1>
    <p>An Operating System (OS) is a software that manages the hardware and software of a computer. It acts as a bridge between the user and the computer. The OS provides various services to ensure smooth operation and efficient resource management.</p>
    <p>Letâ€™s explore the main services of an operating system with simple explanations and examples.</p>

    <h2>1. Process Management</h2>
    <p>The OS manages processes (running programs) by allocating CPU time and resources. It ensures multiple programs can run efficiently without interfering with each other.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> When you open a web browser and play a song in a music player at the same time, the OS ensures both applications run smoothly without crashing. The OS uses multitasking, which allows multiple applications to run at the same time.</p>

    <h2>2. Memory Management</h2>
    <p>The OS manages RAM (Random Access Memory) and ensures that each program gets enough memory to run without interfering with others.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Suppose you open MS Word, Google Chrome, and VLC Media Player at the same time. The OS allocates memory to each program so they work without slowing down the system. If there is not enough RAM, the OS uses virtual memory (part of the hard disk) to prevent crashes.</p>

    <h2>3. File Management</h2>
    <p>The OS organizes and manages files stored on the computer. It provides operations like creating, saving, deleting, renaming, and moving files.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> When you save a Word document, the OS stores it in a specific location (e.g., Documents folder). If you want to copy a file from a USB drive to your computer, the OS handles the process.</p>

    <h2>4. Device Management</h2>
    <p>The OS manages hardware devices like printers, keyboards, mice, and USB drives. It ensures smooth communication between software and hardware.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> When you connect a printer, the OS detects it and installs the necessary drivers. When you insert a USB drive, the OS recognizes it and allows you to access the files.</p>

    <h2>5. Security and Protection</h2>
    <p>The OS provides security features to protect data and prevent unauthorized access.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>User Authentication: You need to enter a password or PIN to log into Windows.</li>
        <li>Antivirus Support: The OS allows security software to detect and remove viruses.</li>
        <li>File Permissions: You can restrict access to files so only certain users can open them.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. User Interface</h2>
    <p>The OS provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) or Command Line Interface (CLI) to interact with the system.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>GUI (Graphical Interface): Windows OS allows you to use a mouse and icons to navigate.</li>
        <li>CLI (Command Line Interface): In Linux, you can type commands like <code>mkdir NewFolder</code> to create a folder.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Networking Services</h2>
    <p>The OS allows computers to connect to the internet and communicate with other devices.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>When you connect to Wi-Fi, the OS manages the connection.</li>
        <li>When you send an email, the OS helps transfer data through the network.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Error Detection and Handling</h2>
    <p>The OS continuously monitors the system for errors and fixes them to prevent crashes.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>If an application stops responding, the OS shows a message like "Not Responding" and allows you to force close it.</li>
        <li>If there is a hard disk failure, the OS may display an alert and recommend solutions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The Operating System is like a manager that controls everything in a computer. It ensures smooth operation by managing processes, memory, files, devices, security, user interfaces, networking, and errors. Without an OS, using a computer would be very difficult.</p>
