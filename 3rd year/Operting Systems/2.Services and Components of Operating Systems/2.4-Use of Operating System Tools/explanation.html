    <h1>2.4 Use of Operating System Tools</h1>
    <p>The Operating System (OS) is like the manager of your computer. It helps control different things like users, security, devices, and performance. To make things easier, the OS provides built-in tools that help users manage their computers effectively.</p>
    <p>In this topic, we will discuss five important OS tools:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>User Management</li>
      <li>Security Policy</li>
      <li>Device Management</li>
      <li>Performance Monitor</li>
      <li>Task Scheduler</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each of these tools plays a key role in keeping the computer system running smoothly. Let's go through them one by one with simple explanations and examples.</p>
  
    <h2>1. User Management</h2>
    <p>User Management is the process of creating, modifying, and deleting user accounts on a computer or network. This tool helps control who can access the system and what they can do.</p>
    <h3>Why is User Management Important?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Prevents unauthorized access to the system.</li>
      <li>Helps in assigning different permissions to different users.</li>
      <li>Allows multiple users to use the same computer with their own settings.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Examples of User Management:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>In Windows OS, you can go to Control Panel → User Accounts to manage users.</li>
      <li>In Linux, you can use commands like:</li>
      <ul>
        <li><code>adduser username</code> → To create a new user.</li>
        <li><code>deluser username</code> → To remove a user.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <h3>Real-Life Example:</h3>
    <p>Imagine a school computer lab. The teacher has an admin account that can install software, but students have limited accounts that cannot change system settings. This ensures security and control over the system.</p>
  
    <h2>2. Security Policy</h2>
    <p>A Security Policy in an OS defines rules and settings that protect the computer from threats like hacking, viruses, and unauthorized access.</p>
    <h3>Why is Security Policy Important?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Protects sensitive data from hackers and malware.</li>
      <li>Prevents unauthorized users from accessing the system.</li>
      <li>Helps in password management and account security.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Examples of Security Policy:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Password Policies:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Enforcing strong passwords (at least 8 characters, including symbols).</li>
        <li>Locking accounts after multiple wrong password attempts.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Firewall Settings: Blocks harmful connections from the internet.</li>
      <li>Antivirus & Windows Defender: Scans the system for viruses and malware.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Real-Life Example:</h3>
    <p>When you try to log in to your email, and after 3 wrong attempts, your account gets locked for security reasons. This is an example of a security policy in action.</p>
  
    <h2>3. Device Management</h2>
    <p>Device Management refers to the way the OS handles hardware devices like printers, keyboards, and USB drives.</p>
    <h3>Why is Device Management Important?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Helps in installing drivers so that devices work properly.</li>
      <li>Ensures that devices communicate correctly with the OS.</li>
      <li>Allows enabling or disabling devices when needed.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Examples of Device Management:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>In Windows, you can go to Device Manager (devmgmt.msc) to see all connected devices.</li>
      <li>In Linux, commands like <code>lsusb</code> and <code>lspci</code> list connected devices.</li>
      <li>If a printer is not working, you can update its driver through Device Manager.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Real-Life Example:</h3>
    <p>When you connect a new printer to your computer, the OS automatically installs a driver so that you can print documents. If there’s an issue, you might need to update or reinstall the driver using Device Manager.</p>
  
    <h2>4. Performance Monitor</h2>
    <p>A Performance Monitor is a tool that helps check how well your computer is working. It shows details about CPU usage, memory usage, disk activity, and network activity.</p>
    <h3>Why is Performance Monitor Important?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Helps in finding slow or malfunctioning applications.</li>
      <li>Identifies high CPU or memory usage that may slow down the system.</li>
      <li>Monitors network activity to detect potential security issues.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Examples of Performance Monitor:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Windows Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc): Shows CPU, RAM, and Disk usage in real-time.</li>
      <li>Linux: Using <code>top</code> or <code>htop</code> commands: Displays CPU and memory usage in real-time.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Real-Life Example:</h3>
    <p>If your laptop is running slow, you can open Task Manager and see if a particular program is using too much CPU or RAM. You can then close that program to speed up your system.</p>
  
    <h2>5. Task Scheduler</h2>
    <p>Task Scheduler is a tool that helps automate tasks by scheduling them to run at a specific time.</p>
    <h3>Why is Task Scheduler Important?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Helps in automating system tasks (e.g., backups, updates).</li>
      <li>Reduces the need for manual work.</li>
      <li>Ensures that important tasks run even if the user forgets.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Examples of Task Scheduler:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Windows Task Scheduler (<code>taskschd.msc</code>): Automatically runs antivirus scans every night.</li>
      <li>Linux Cron Jobs (<code>crontab -e</code>): Automates tasks like file backups or system updates.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Real-Life Example:</h3>
    <p>Imagine you want your computer to back up files every night at 2 AM. Instead of doing it manually, you can use Task Scheduler to set up an automatic backup.</p>
