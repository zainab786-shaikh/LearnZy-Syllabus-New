    <h1>2.2 System Calls â€“ Concept, Types of System Calls</h1>
    <h2>What is a System Call?</h2>
    <p>A system call is a way for a program to request a service from the operating system. Think of it as a bridge between the user and the operating system.</p>
    <p>Imagine you are in a restaurant. You (the user) want food, but you cannot directly enter the kitchen to cook. Instead, you call a waiter (system call) who takes your request to the kitchen (operating system). The kitchen prepares the food and gives it to the waiter, who delivers it back to you.</p>
    <p>Similarly, when a program needs to perform a task (like reading a file or printing something), it cannot do it directly. It asks the operating system using a system call.</p>
    
    <h2>Why Are System Calls Important?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>They allow user programs to interact with hardware (files, memory, network, etc.).</li>
      <li>They ensure security by controlling access to system resources.</li>
      <li>They simplify programming since developers donâ€™t need to write code for low-level hardware operations.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h2>Types of System Calls</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Process Control System Calls</li>
      <li>File Management System Calls</li>
      <li>Device Management System Calls</li>
      <li>Information Maintenance System Calls</li>
      <li>Communication System Calls</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h3>1. Process Control System Calls</h3>
    <p>A process is any program that is running on a computer. These system calls help to start, stop, or manage a process.</p>
    <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>fork()</code> â€“ Creates a new process (like making a photocopy of a document).</li>
      <li><code>exec()</code> â€“ Runs a new program (like switching from a music app to a video app).</li>
      <li><code>exit()</code> â€“ Stops a process (like closing an app on your phone).</li>
      <li><code>wait()</code> â€“ Makes a process wait for another to finish (like waiting for a friend before leaving together).</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h3>2. File Management System Calls</h3>
    <p>Computers store data in files. These system calls help in creating, opening, reading, writing, and closing files.</p>
    <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>open()</code> â€“ Opens a file (like opening a book).</li>
      <li><code>read()</code> â€“ Reads data from a file (like reading a page).</li>
      <li><code>write()</code> â€“ Writes data to a file (like writing in a notebook).</li>
      <li><code>close()</code> â€“ Closes a file (like closing a book after reading).</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h3>3. Device Management System Calls</h3>
    <p>Computers use various devices like printers, keyboards, and USB drives. These system calls help in managing hardware devices.</p>
    <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>ioctl()</code> â€“ Controls a device (like adjusting volume on speakers).</li>
      <li><code>read()</code> and <code>write()</code> â€“ Transfer data to/from a device (like sending a document to a printer).</li>
      <li><code>close()</code> â€“ Releases a device (like unplugging a USB drive safely).</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h3>4. Information Maintenance System Calls</h3>
    <p>These system calls provide system-related information such as date, time, memory usage, and process details.</p>
    <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>getpid()</code> â€“ Gets the process ID (like finding your student ID).</li>
      <li><code>alarm()</code> â€“ Sets a timer (like setting an alarm on your phone).</li>
      <li><code>gettimeofday()</code> â€“ Gets the current date and time (like checking the time on your phone).</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h3>5. Communication System Calls</h3>
    <p>These system calls help programs exchange data with each other or over a network.</p>
    <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>pipe()</code> â€“ Allows two processes to communicate (like passing a note in class).</li>
      <li><code>send()</code> and <code>recv()</code> â€“ Send and receive messages (like sending a WhatsApp message).</li>
      <li><code>connect()</code> â€“ Connects to a server (like opening a website).</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>System calls are essential for a computer to function. They allow programs to interact with the operating system securely and efficiently. Without system calls, even simple tasks like opening a file, printing a document, or browsing the internet wouldnâ€™t be possible.</p>
