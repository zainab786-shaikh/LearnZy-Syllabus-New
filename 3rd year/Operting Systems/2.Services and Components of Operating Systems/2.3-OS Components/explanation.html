    <h1>2.3 OS Components</h1>
    <p>An Operating System (OS) is software that manages computer hardware and software resources. It provides services for computer programs and ensures that the system runs smoothly. The OS has several important components that work together to manage different aspects of the computer. Letâ€™s explore them one by one in simple language with examples.</p>
    
    <h2>1. Process Management</h2>
    <p>A process is a running program. The OS manages these processes to ensure they execute efficiently and without interfering with each other.</p>
    <h3>Responsibilities:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Creating and deleting processes.</li>
      <li>Allocating CPU time to processes.</li>
      <li>Managing multitasking (running multiple processes at once).</li>
      <li>Preventing deadlocks (where processes get stuck waiting for each other).</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Example:</h3>
    <p>Imagine you are using a web browser, playing music, and downloading a file at the same time. The OS ensures that each task gets enough CPU time so that everything works smoothly without crashing.</p>
    
    <h2>2. Main Memory Management</h2>
    <p>Main memory (RAM) is where data and programs are stored temporarily while they are being used. The OS manages this memory efficiently to avoid wastage and ensure that each program gets enough space to run properly.</p>
    <h3>Responsibilities:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Allocating and deallocating memory.</li>
      <li>Keeping track of which part of memory is free or occupied.</li>
      <li>Managing virtual memory (using hard disk space as extra memory when RAM is full).</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Example:</h3>
    <p>When you open multiple applications, such as a web browser and a game, the OS ensures that each program gets enough memory to function properly. If RAM is full, it temporarily moves some data to the hard drive (virtual memory) to free up space.</p>
    
    <h2>3. File Management</h2>
    <p>A file is a collection of data stored on a computer. The OS manages all files on a system, ensuring they are stored, retrieved, and organized properly.</p>
    <h3>Responsibilities:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Creating, deleting, reading, and writing files.</li>
      <li>Managing file storage locations (folders/directories).</li>
      <li>Controlling access permissions (who can read or edit a file).</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Example:</h3>
    <p>When you save a Word document, the OS decides where to store it on the hard drive and keeps track of its location so you can find it later.</p>
    
    <h2>4. I/O System Management</h2>
    <p>The Input/Output (I/O) system manages communication between the computer and external devices such as keyboards, mice, printers, and USB drives.</p>
    <h3>Responsibilities:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Detecting and connecting input/output devices.</li>
      <li>Managing data transfer between the OS and devices.</li>
      <li>Handling device drivers (software that allows the OS to communicate with hardware).</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Example:</h3>
    <p>When you plug in a USB drive, the OS detects it, assigns it a drive letter (e.g., "D:"), and allows you to access the files stored on it.</p>
    
    <h2>5. Secondary Storage Management</h2>
    <p>Secondary storage refers to hard drives, SSDs, CDs, and external drives, where data is stored permanently (unlike RAM, which is temporary).</p>
    <h3>Responsibilities:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Organizing data in storage devices.</li>
      <li>Ensuring efficient file retrieval and storage.</li>
      <li>Managing free space and disk partitions.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Example:</h3>
    <p>When you install a new software application, the OS finds space on your hard drive and stores the necessary files in an organized way so the software can function correctly.</p>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>These OS components work together to ensure that the computer runs smoothly, processes are managed efficiently, and users can store and retrieve files without issues. Without an OS, using a computer would be extremely difficult since we would have to manually manage hardware and software operations.</p>
    <p>Understanding these components helps us appreciate how operating systems make our computing experience seamless and efficient.</p>
