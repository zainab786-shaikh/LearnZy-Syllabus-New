    <h1>1.3 Command Line Based OS & GUI Based OS</h1>
    <p>Operating Systems (OS) are the software that help users interact with the computer. Based on the interface, they can be categorized into two types:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Command Line Based OS â€“ DOS, UNIX</li>
      <li>Graphical User Interface (GUI) Based OS â€“ Windows, Linux</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Letâ€™s understand both with examples.</p>
  
    <h2>1. Command Line Based Operating Systems</h2>
    <p>A Command Line Interface (CLI) operating system requires users to type text commands to perform tasks. It does not have a mouse or graphical icons.</p>
    
    <h3>1.1 DOS (Disk Operating System)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>DOS was one of the earliest operating systems used on personal computers.</li>
      <li>It was developed by Microsoft in the 1980s.</li>
      <li>DOS operates using commands typed in a black screen (Command Prompt).</li>
      <li>No graphical interface, only text commands.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Examples of DOS Commands</h4>
    <pre>
      dir â€“ Displays files and folders in the current directory.
      C:\> dir
  
      cd â€“ Changes the current directory.
      C:\> cd Documents
  
      copy â€“ Copies files from one location to another.
      C:\> copy file1.txt D:\
  
      del â€“ Deletes a file.
      C:\> del file1.txt
    </pre>
    <p><strong>ðŸ‘‰ Use Case:</strong> In the early days, users had to type commands to open files, delete files, or move between folders.</p>
  
    <h3>1.2 UNIX</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>UNIX is a powerful, multi-user operating system mainly used in servers and mainframe computers.</li>
      <li>Developed in 1969 at AT&T Bell Labs.</li>
      <li>Commands are typed in a Terminal (similar to DOS).</li>
      <li>Used in universities, research centers, and big organizations.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Examples of UNIX Commands</h4>
    <pre>
      ls â€“ Lists files in a directory.
      $ ls
  
      pwd â€“ Shows the current working directory.
      $ pwd
  
      mkdir â€“ Creates a new directory.
      $ mkdir myfolder
  
      rm â€“ Deletes a file.
      $ rm file.txt
    </pre>
    <p><strong>ðŸ‘‰ Use Case:</strong> UNIX is still widely used for web servers and databases because it is secure and stable.</p>
  
    <h2>2. GUI Based Operating Systems</h2>
    <p>A Graphical User Interface (GUI) OS allows users to interact using icons, windows, and a mouse instead of typing commands.</p>
  
    <h3>2.1 Windows</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Developed by Microsoft in 1985.</li>
      <li>One of the most popular OS for personal computers.</li>
      <li>Uses icons, start menu, taskbar, and file explorer.</li>
      <li>Very easy to use compared to CLI-based OS like DOS or UNIX.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Examples of GUI Features in Windows</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Opening a file â€“ Double-click a file instead of using <code>open filename</code> command.</li>
      <li>Copying files â€“ Drag and drop files instead of typing <code>copy file1.txt D:\</code>.</li>
      <li>Installing software â€“ Click "Install" instead of running manual commands.</li>
      <li>Shutting down â€“ Click "Start â†’ Shut Down" instead of typing <code>shutdown -h</code>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>ðŸ‘‰ Use Case:</strong> Windows is widely used in homes, offices, and schools because it is user-friendly.</p>
  
    <h3>2.2 Linux</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Developed in 1991 by Linus Torvalds.</li>
      <li>It is open-source, meaning it is free to use and modify.</li>
      <li>Comes in different versions like Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian.</li>
      <li>Supports both CLI and GUI.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Examples of GUI Features in Linux</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>File Management â€“ Click folders to open instead of using <code>ls</code> command.</li>
      <li>Web Browsing â€“ Use Firefox or Chrome instead of typing <code>wget</code> command.</li>
      <li>Installing Software â€“ Use "Ubuntu Software Center" instead of typing <code>sudo apt install</code>.</li>
      <li>System Settings â€“ Change volume, display, and network settings through a GUI menu.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>ðŸ‘‰ Use Case:</strong> Linux is widely used by developers, servers, and cybersecurity experts.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>CLI-based OS (DOS, UNIX) is fast but requires users to remember commands.</p>
    <p>GUI-based OS (Windows, Linux) is easier to use with a graphical interface.</p>
    <p>Windows is more user-friendly, while Linux is used for security and development.</p>
    
    <h3>Simple Analogy</h3>
    <p>ðŸ’¡ Imagine you want to listen to music:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>CLI OS (DOS, UNIX):</strong> You type a command like <code>play music.mp3</code>.</li>
      <li><strong>GUI OS (Windows, Linux):</strong> You simply double-click the file, and it plays.</li>
    </ul>
