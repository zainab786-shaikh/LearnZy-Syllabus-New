    <h1>1.1 Operating System (OS)</h1>
    <h2>What is an Operating System (OS)?</h2>
    <p>An Operating System (OS) is a software that acts as an interface between the user and the computer hardware. It helps users perform tasks like running applications, managing files, and using computer resources efficiently.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Think of an OS like a manager in a company. The manager ensures that employees (applications) get the right resources (CPU, memory, etc.) to work efficiently without conflicts.</p>
    <h3>Some common operating systems:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Windows (Used in most personal computers)</li>
      <li>macOS (Used in Apple computers)</li>
      <li>Linux (Used in servers and programming)</li>
      <li>Android (Used in mobile phones)</li>
      <li>iOS (Used in Apple mobile devices)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Components of an Operating System</h2>
    <h3>1. Kernel</h3>
    <p>The kernel is the core part of the OS. It directly interacts with the hardware and manages system resources.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Think of the kernel as a chef in a restaurant. It takes orders from customers (users) and prepares food (processes tasks) using kitchen tools (hardware).</p>
    
    <h3>2. Process Management</h3>
    <p>It manages running applications (called processes) and ensures that CPU time is given to different tasks efficiently.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> If you open multiple apps on your phone (like WhatsApp and YouTube), the OS decides which app runs in the background and which one is active.</p>
    
    <h3>3. Memory Management</h3>
    <p>It allocates and deallocates memory (RAM) to programs so they can run efficiently.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> If you have 4GB RAM and you open Chrome, Word, and Spotify, the OS decides how much memory each application gets.</p>
    
    <h3>4. File System Management</h3>
    <p>It helps in storing, retrieving, and organizing files on storage devices like Hard Drives or SSDs.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> When you save a document in C:\Documents\file.docx, the OS keeps track of where it is stored so you can access it later.</p>
    
    <h3>5. Device Management</h3>
    <p>It controls hardware devices like keyboards, printers, and USB drives. The OS ensures these devices work properly.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> When you plug in a pen drive, the OS detects it and allows you to transfer files.</p>
    
    <h3>6. User Interface</h3>
    <p>It provides a way for users to interact with the computer, such as Graphical User Interface (GUI) and Command Line Interface (CLI).</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> GUI: Windows with icons and buttons (like in Windows 10). CLI: Commands typed in a terminal (like in Linux).</p>
    
    <h2>Operations of an Operating System</h2>
    <h3>1. Program Management</h3>
    <p>OS loads, runs, and closes programs. It manages multiple programs using multitasking.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> When you open a web browser and a video editor at the same time, the OS ensures both run without crashing.</p>
    
    <h3>2. Resource Management</h3>
    <p>The OS distributes CPU time, memory, and disk space efficiently among processes.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> In a bank, multiple employees (processes) need computers (resources). The OS ensures every process gets its share.</p>
    
    <h3>3. Security and Protection</h3>
    <p>OS protects the system from viruses, hackers, and unauthorized access. It provides password protection, firewalls, and encryption.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Your phone has a password or fingerprint lockâ€”this is the OS ensuring security.</p>
    
    <h2>Views of an Operating System</h2>
    <h3>1. User View</h3>
    <p>Focuses on how users interact with the OS. Users care about ease of use, speed, and efficiency.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> When you use Windows, you see icons, folders, and a Start menu, making it easy to use.</p>
    
    <h3>2. System View</h3>
    <p>Focuses on how the OS manages hardware and resources internally. The OS ensures that hardware components work efficiently together.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Inside your laptop, the OS manages RAM, CPU, and storage to ensure smooth performance.</p>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>An Operating System (OS) is like the brain of a computer. It manages everything, from running programs to ensuring security. Without an OS, using a computer would be very difficult.</p>
