    <h1>Different Types of Operating Systems</h1>
    <p>An Operating System (OS) is the main software that controls a computer. It manages hardware (like the keyboard, mouse, and memory), runs programs, and allows users to interact with the computer. Different types of operating systems are used for different purposes. Let's explore them one by one with easy examples.</p>
  
    <h2>1. Batch Operating System</h2>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A Batch Operating System processes a group (batch) of similar jobs automatically without user interaction.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> A bank processing cheques in batches.</p>
    <p><strong>Real-life Example:</strong> IBM mainframe computers used for payroll processing.</p>
    <p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>No direct user interaction during execution.</li>
      <li>Jobs are processed in a queue (first-come, first-served).</li>
      <li>Used for tasks like payroll processing and billing.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h2>2. Multi-Programmed Operating System</h2>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A Multi-Programmed OS allows multiple programs to run at the same time by managing CPU usage efficiently.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Downloading a movie while listening to music.</p>
    <p><strong>Real-life Example:</strong> Windows and macOS allowing multiple applications to run.</p>
    <p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Increases CPU utilization by switching between programs.</li>
      <li>Multiple users can use the computer at the same time.</li>
      <li>Reduces CPU idle time.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h2>3. Time-Shared Operating System</h2>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A Time-Shared OS allows multiple users to share the same computer resources by giving each user a small time slot.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> A teacher allowing students to speak one by one.</p>
    <p><strong>Real-life Example:</strong> Cloud computing services like Google Drive.</p>
    <p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Allows multiple users to work simultaneously.</li>
      <li>CPU switches between users quickly.</li>
      <li>Reduces waiting time for users.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h2>4. Multiprocessor Operating System</h2>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A Multiprocessor OS is designed to work with computers that have multiple processors.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> A restaurant with multiple chefs working together.</p>
    <p><strong>Real-life Example:</strong> Supercomputers used in weather forecasting.</p>
    <p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Multiple processors work together for better performance.</li>
      <li>Increases speed and efficiency.</li>
      <li>Used in supercomputers and high-performance applications.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h2>5. Distributed Operating System</h2>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A Distributed OS connects multiple computers over a network to act as a single system.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Food delivery services like Zomato connecting restaurants and customers.</p>
    <p><strong>Real-life Example:</strong> Google Search running on multiple computers.</p>
    <p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Multiple computers work together like a single system.</li>
      <li>Increases speed and fault tolerance.</li>
      <li>Used in cloud computing and large-scale applications.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h2>6. Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)</h2>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A Real-Time OS processes data and responds immediately without delays.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Airbag deployment in cars.</p>
    <p><strong>Real-life Example:</strong> Medical devices and air traffic control systems.</p>
    <p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Processes data instantly with no delay.</li>
      <li>Used in critical applications like healthcare and aviation.</li>
      <li>Two types: Hard Real-Time OS (zero delay) and Soft Real-Time OS (minimal delay).</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h2>7. Mobile Operating Systems (Android & iOS)</h2>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A Mobile OS is designed for smartphones and tablets.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Running multiple apps on a phone.</p>
    <p><strong>Types of Mobile OS:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Android OS:</strong> Developed by Google, open-source.</li>
      <li><strong>iOS:</strong> Developed by Apple, closed-source.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>User-friendly and designed for touchscreens.</li>
      <li>Manages apps, security, and hardware.</li>
      <li>Used in smartphones, tablets, and smart devices.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Different operating systems are designed for different purposes. Batch OS is used for automated job processing, while Multi-Programmed OS and Time-Shared OS improve efficiency. Multiprocessor OS increases speed using multiple CPUs, and Distributed OS connects multiple systems. Real-Time OS is used in critical applications, while Mobile OS powers our smartphones.</p>
    <p>Understanding these types helps us appreciate how computers, mobile phones, and large-scale systems work efficiently. ðŸš€</p>
